<h3>Overlaying VBT's</h3>


The program
<a href="./Overlay.m3">Overlay.m3</a>
illustrates the usage of a TSplit.
A TSplit is a container window that
gives its entire screen to one child at a time.
The program
constructs a Tsplit
with 2 children and displays it along with a button
labeled <code>Next</code>.
Initially one of the
two children will be displayed.
Each time <code>Next</code> button is clicked,
the other child will occupy whole of the Tsplit's window.
<p>

The current child can be obtained by calling:
<pre>
Tsplit.GetCurrent
</pre>
and a child can be set as TSplit's current child by calling:
<pre>
Tsplit.SetCurrent
</pre>
<p>



Two views of the application while it is running are shown in
the following images:
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../overlay/overlay1.gif">Overlay 1
  <li> <img src="../overlay/overlay2.gif">Overlay 2
</ul>
The TSplit has two children, each a color picture.
One picture is rare stamp, other other a windmill.
The images are from files in the portable bitmap (pbm) format.
A VBT can be made from a pbm file using the code given in the
appendices.
The module <code>Picture</code> prepares two VBTs
<code>stampVBT</code> and <code>wind_millVBT</code>
for easy inclusion into a Modula-3 program.
