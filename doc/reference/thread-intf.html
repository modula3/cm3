<H2>The Thread interface</H2>
<P>

If a shared variable is written concurrently by two threads, or written
by one and read concurrently by another, the effect is to set the
variable to an implementation-dependent value of its type.
For example, if one thread writes <TT>a[0]</TT> while another
concurrently writes <TT>a[1]</TT>, one of the writes might be lost.
Thus, portable programs must
use the <TT>Thread</TT> interface to provide mutual exclusion for shared
variables.

<PRE>
INTERFACE Thread;

TYPE
  T <: REFANY;
  Mutex =  MUTEX;
  Condition <: ROOT;
  Closure = OBJECT METHODS apply(): REFANY END;
</PRE>
A <TT>Thread.T</TT> is a handle on a thread.  A <TT>Mutex</TT> is locked
by some thread, or unlocked.  A <TT>Condition</TT> is a set of waiting
threads.  A newly-allocated <TT>Mutex</TT> is unlocked; a newly-allocated
<TT>Condition</TT> is empty.  It is a checked runtime error to pass the
<TT>NIL</TT> <TT>Mutex</TT>, <TT>Condition</TT>, or <TT>T</TT> to any
procedure in this interface.
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Fork(cl: Closure): T;
</PRE>
A handle on a newly-created thread executing <TT>cl.apply()</TT>. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Join(t: T): REFANY;
</PRE>
Wait until <TT>t</TT> has terminated and return its result.  It is a
checked error to call this more than once for any <TT>t</TT>. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Wait(m: Mutex; c: Condition);
</PRE>
The calling thread must have <TT>m</TT> locked.  Atomically unlocks 
<TT>m</TT> and waits on <TT>c</TT>.  Then relocks <TT>m</TT> and returns. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Acquire(m: Mutex);
</PRE>
Wait until <TT>m</TT> is unlocked and then lock it. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Release(m: Mutex);
</PRE>
The calling thread must have <TT>m</TT> locked.  Unlocks <TT>m</TT>. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Broadcast(c: Condition);
</PRE>
All threads waiting on <TT>c</TT> become eligible to run.  
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Signal(c: Condition);
</PRE>
One or more threads waiting on <TT>c</TT> become eligible to run. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Self(): T;
</PRE>
Return the handle of the calling thread. 
<P>

<PRE>
EXCEPTION Alerted;
</PRE>
Used to approximate asynchronous interrupts.
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE Alert(t: T);
</PRE>
Mark <TT>t</TT> as an alerted thread. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE TestAlert(): BOOLEAN;
</PRE>
<TT>TRUE</TT> if the calling thread has been marked alerted. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE AlertWait(m: Mutex; c: Condition) RAISES {Alerted};
</PRE>
Like <TT>Wait</TT>, but if the thread is marked alerted at the time of
call or sometime during the wait, lock <TT>m</TT> and raise <TT>Alerted</TT>. 
<P>

<PRE>
PROCEDURE AlertJoin(t: T): REFANY RAISES {Alerted};
</PRE>
Like <TT>Join</TT>, but if the calling thread is marked alerted at 
the time of call or sometime during the wait, raise <TT>Alerted</TT>.  
<P>

<PRE>
CONST
  AtomicSize = ...;
</PRE>
An implementation-dependent integer constant: the number of bits in
a memory-coherent block.  If two components of a record or array fall
in different blocks, they can be accessed concurrently by different
threads without locking.
<P>

<PRE>
END Thread.
