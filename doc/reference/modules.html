<H2>Modules</H2>
<P>

A module has the form:
<PRE>
    MODULE id EXPORTS Interfaces;
      Imports;
    Block id.
</PRE>
where <TT>id</TT> is an identifier that names the module, <TT>Interfaces</TT> 
is a list of distinct names of interfaces exported by the module, 
<TT>Imports</TT> is a list of import statements, and <TT>Block</TT> is 
a block, the <EM>body</EM> of the module.  The name <TT>id</TT> must be 
repeated after the <TT>END</TT> that terminates the body.
"<TT>EXPORTS Interfaces</TT>" can be omitted,
in which case <TT>Interfaces</TT> defaults 
to <TT>id</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.143>If</A>
module <TT>M</TT> exports interface <TT>I</TT>, then all declared names 
in <TT>I</TT> are visible without qualification in <TT>M</TT>.   Any 
procedure declared in <TT>I</TT> can be redeclared in <TT>M</TT>, with 
a body.  The signature in <TT>M</TT> must be
<A HREF="procs.html#idx.54">covered</A> by the signature 
in <TT>I</TT>.
To determine the interpretation of keyword 
bindings in calls to the procedure, the signature in <TT>M</TT>  
is used within <TT>M</TT>; the signature in <TT>I</TT> is used everywhere 
else.
<P>

Except for the redeclaration of exported procedures, the names declared 
at the top level of <TT>Block</TT>, the visible imported names, and 
the names declared in the exported interfaces must be distinct.
<P>

For example, the following is illegal, since two names in exported
interfaces coincide:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I;
      PROCEDURE X();  ...

    INTERFACE J;
      PROCEDURE X();  ...

    MODULE M EXPORTS I, J;
      PROCEDURE X() = ...;
</PRE>
<P>

The following is also illegal, since the visible imported name
<TT>X</TT> coincides with the top-level name <TT>X</TT>:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I;
      PROCEDURE X();  ...

    MODULE M EXPORTS I;
      FROM I IMPORT X;
      PROCEDURE X() = ...;
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.144>But</A>
the following is legal, although peculiar:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I;
      PROCEDURE X(...);  ...

    MODULE M EXPORTS I;
      IMPORT I;
      PROCEDURE X(...) = ...;
</PRE>
<P>

since the only visible imported name is <TT>I</TT>, and the coincidence 
between <TT>X</TT> as a top-level name and <TT>X</TT> as a name in an 
exported interface is allowed, assuming the interface signature covers 
the module signature.  Within <TT>M</TT>, the interface declaration 
determines the signature of <TT>I.X</TT> and the module declaration 
determines the signature of <TT>X</TT>.
