<H2>Importing packages</H2>
<P>

<B> import(P) </B>  
          The library and visible sources of package <TT>P</TT> are
          available to satisfy <TT>IMPORT</TT> requests in the current
          compilation.  The imported sources are not recompiled.
 
<P>

<B> import_version(P, BuildDir) </B>
Like <TT>import(P)</TT>, but the library and visible sources of
package <TT>P</TT> are selected from building directory <TT>BuildDir</TT>
rather than the default building directory for the current platform.

<P>

<B> include_dir(D) </B>  
          Recursively include the sources named in the <TT>m3makefile</TT>
          in subdirectory <TT>D</TT> of the current directory.
 
<P>

<B> include_pkg(P) </B>  
          Include the sources named in package <TT>P</TT>'s
          <TT>src/m3makefile</TT>.  The location of P may be
          <A HREF="overrides.html">overridden</A>.
<P>
<P>

<TT>Import</TT> reflects the fact that programs are built from separately
compiled pieces, rather than being compiled as a whole.  If we always
compiled from source, <TT>include</TT> would suffice.
