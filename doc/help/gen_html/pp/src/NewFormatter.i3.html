  A Formatter.T is a basic tool for <CODE>pretty printing,</CODE> the printing
  of structured objects with appropriate line breaks and indentation.
<P>
  This version of the formatter uses the FBE (formatter backend) interface
  to produce multi-font output. The caller must get an FBE.T from one of
  the FBEFoo interfaces and pass it to New. All widths in the remaining
  functions are expressed in the units of the FBE.T.

    A Formatter.T is a filter which takes a sequence of /expressions/
    and converts them into a sequence of characters, which are sent to
    an underlying Wr.T.

    The input expressions consist of character strings intermixed with
    /formatting operators/ that specify a set of possible line breaks,
    and the relative alignment of parts in multi-line expressions.  The
    SxFormatter.T chooses a &quot;good&quot; subset of the given line breaks,
    inserts newlines and padding whitespaces at those points, and writes
    the result to the underlying writer. *)

<P> 
  The following procedures send line breaking operators to the formatter.
  There are four kinds of line breaks:  
<P>
      Break
      BreakOpt
      PartialBreak
      NewLine
      UnitedBreak
<P>
  Precedence decreases from top to bottom.  That is, the input expresion
  stream is parsed as a sequence of <CODE>terms</CODE> separated by /UnitedBreak/s;
  each <CODE>term</CODE> is parsed as a sequence of <CODE>factors</CODE> separated by
  /NewLine/s; and so on.  These precedences can be overriden
  by enclosing expressions between /Group/ and /End/ operators (see
  below). 

<P><PRE>TYPE BreakType = {NonOptimal, OptimalBreak, OptimalNoBreak};

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#Break">Break</A> (t: T;  offset := 0.0;  type := BreakType.OptimalBreak;  freshLine := TRUE)
  RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    Specifies an optional line break.

    Breaks come in three types:

    NonOptimal:  If the expressions /e1, e2, .../ following the /Break/
    (up to the next line break or /End/) can be printed on the current
    line without exceeding the line width, they are so printed.
    Otherwise, a NewLine(t, offset, freshLine) is performed and the
    expressions are then printed.

    OptimalBreak, OptimalNoBreak: Two possibilities are compared:

        1. Printing the expressions /e1, e2, .../ without any
           preceeding newline.

        2. Doing a NewLine(t, offset, freshLine) and then printing
           those expressions.

    The option that uses fewer lines without exceeding the line width
    is chosen.  Ties are broken in favor of either 1 (OptimalNoBreak)
    or 2 (OptimalBreak).

    In general, optimal breaks are more expensive than
    non-optimal ones. *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#PartialBreak">PartialBreak</A> (t: T;  offset := 0.0;  freshLine := TRUE)
  RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    Performs a Newline(t, offset, freshLine) if more than one line
    has been used up to this point to print the current innermost
    object delimited by Begin/End. *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#NewLine">NewLine</A> (t: T;  offset := 0.0;  freshLine := TRUE)
  RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    Starts a new line indented /offset/ spaces from the current left
    margin (see /Begin/).   If /freshline/ is true, starts a newline only if
    /leftMargin + offset &lt; c/, where /c/ is the current column of the
    current position. *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#UnitedBreak">UnitedBreak</A> (t: T;  offset := 0.0;  freshLine := TRUE)
  RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    Inserts a new member of an all-or-none group of line breaks.

    If all the expressions in the innermost /Group/ or /Begin/ can be
    printed so that they all fit on the current line, then they are
    so printed, and every top-level /UnitedBreak/ in that group is ignored.
    Otherwise, every top-level /UnitedBreak/ in that group is
    equivalent to a NewLine(t, offset, freshLine). *)

********************************************************

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#Group">Group</A> (t: T) RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    Logical parenthesis: the expressions between a /Group/ and the matching
    /End/ will be treated as a single expression. *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#Begin">Begin</A> (t: T;  offset := 0.0;  width := FBE.MaxWidth)
  RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    The operators /Begin/ and /End/ delimit a structured object,
    consisting of the enclosed expressions and formatting operators.

    /Begin/ establishes a new left margin &quot;offset&quot; spaces to the right
    of the first character of the object.  Any line breaks occuring
    in the printing of the enclosed expressions will be relative to
    this new margin.  If &quot;offset&quot; = LAST( INTEGER ), then the current
    left margin is retained.

    If /width/ &lt; LAST(INTEGER), the enclosed expressions are printed
    assuming this new nominal line width.

    The old left margin and line width are restored after the object
    has been printed.  *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#Align">Align</A> (
    t:            T;
    columns:      CARDINAL;
    tryOneLine:   BOOLEAN := TRUE;
    offset:       REAL := 0.0;
    alignPred:    AlignPred := NIL;
  ) RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    The /Align/ operator produces a table with multiple
    columns, aligned if possible.

    The expressions between the /Align/ and the matching /End/ describe
    the rows of the table.  Each row should be either a list of
    expressions delimited by /Group/ and /End/, or a non-aligned row
    (see NoAlign).  The /offset/ parameter specifies the left-margin
    offset for each row.

    Each expression in a row will be in a separate column.  It is an
    error if a row has more than /columns/ entries, but a row may have
    fewer.

    IF /tryOneLine/ is true and the initial output position is in the
    first line of the enclosing Begin/End object, then Align will
    print all the rows on that one line (if they fit).

    Align will align the maximal set of leading rows such that each row
    fits on a single line, each row's columns satisfy the /alignPred/
    predicate, and the row is not a NoAlign row.  Then it will
    recursively align the rest of the rows without regard to the
    alignment of the leading rows.  *)

TYPE
  AlignPred = OBJECT METHODS

      pred (
        column:   CARDINAL;
        maxWidth: REAL;
        width:    REAL
      ): BOOLEAN;

    END;
  (*
    If the /alignPred/ parameter of /Align/ is non-nil, then

        alignPred.pred(arg, column, maxWidth, width)

    is called for each column in each row, where /column/ is the 0-based
    column number, /maxWidth/ is the maximum width of that column in
    the previous rows being aligned, and /width/ is the width of column
    in the current row.

    If any of these calls returns FALSE, the entire row is printed
    without any column alignment, as if it were preceded by a /NoAlign/
    operator. *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#NoAlign">NoAlign</A> (t: T) RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    A /NoAlign/ operator, valid only as a top-level member in an
    Align/End group, specifies that the following expression /e/ should
    not be aligned with the previous or succeeding rows, and should
    not affect their alignment.

    The expression /e/ is printed without any leading newline.
    Typically, /e/ will be a group or a raw text containing its own
    leading newline, but not a trailing newline.  *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#Col">Col</A> (t: T; column: REAL; relative := FALSE; space := 0.0)
  RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    If the current position of the formatter is less than &quot;column&quot;
    (zero-based), emit enough spaces to go to that column.  Otherwise, emit
    &quot;space&quot; spaces.  If &quot;relative&quot; is TRUE, interpret &quot;column&quot; as being
    relative to the current left margin; in this case, it is meaningful
    for &quot;column&quot; to be negative. *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="NewFormatter.m3.html#End">End</A> (t: T) RAISES {FBE.Failed};
  (*
    Delineates the end of /Group/, /Begin/, and /Align/ operators.

    The /Flush/ procedure automatically supplies /End/s
    for all unmatched /Group/s, /Begin/s, and /Align/s. *)
