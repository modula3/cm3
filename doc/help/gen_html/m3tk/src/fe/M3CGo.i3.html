</PRE> This interface supports the compilation of a single unit, which is
already open on a given stream.  A callback mechanism is included to
cope with the need to compile imported/exported interfaces.

analysis times. <CODE>phases</CODE> controls exactly which phases are run - the
usual value is AllPhases, but it can be convenient to restrict to just
parsing, for example.  If you ask for a phase which depends on a
previous one that has not been done, the error state for that phase is
set and the call returns.  Unless parsing is enabled, <CODE>stream</CODE> is
ignored completely.  <CODE>headerOnly</CODE> causes parsing to abort after
parsing the exports and import clauses, which is to support fast
dependency analysis.  </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE> Compiler Extension.
<P>
   A client can register extra passes to be applied after the
   standard passes. The <CODE>extend</CODE> method for each registered
   extension will be called with the values of <CODE>context</CODE> and <CODE>phases</CODE>, 
   as passed in to <CODE>CompileUnit</CODE>. The value of <CODE>cu</CODE> will also
   be that passed in, unless the unit is a generic instantation,
   in which case the value of <CODE>cu.as_root.sm_ins_comp_unit</CODE> is
   passed instead. The client must explicitly check that a given
   phase has actually occured (by looking at <CODE>cu.fe_status</CODE>).
   The extension code can report errors with <CODE>M3Error</CODE>, and these
   will be displayed along with those from other passes, after all
   the extensions have completed. The extensions will be applied
   in the order they that they were registered.
