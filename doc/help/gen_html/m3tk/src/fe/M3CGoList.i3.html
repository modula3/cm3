</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> (Try to) compile all the units in the arrays <CODE>interfaces</CODE> and <CODE>modules</CODE>, 
and <CODE>pathNames</CODE>. Any imported/exported units will be looked for in 
<CODE>context</CODE> first, which is created if it is NIL.  If any 
notification callbacks have been registered, they will be called
just before a unit is compiled and just after; any error messages
will already have been generated. If a unit cannot be found
an error message will be generated, and the notifications are
not called. The value of <CODE>phases</CODE> controls exactly which 
phases are run - the usual value is<CODE> AllPhases</CODE>, but it can be convenient 
to restrict to just parsing, for example.  <CODE>phases</CODE> is always updated
with any error flags that occur, which provides a cheap check
for a clean compilation.
<P>
<CODE>interfaces</CODE> and <CODE>modules</CODE> are expect to contain unit names, which are
searched for on the search path. <CODE>pathNames</CODE> are treated literally
and, if they have M3 source extensions, are opened and compiled.
<P>
<CODE>headerOnly</CODE> causes parsing to abort after parsing the exports and 
import clauses, which is to support fast dependency analysis.
<CODE>setPrimarySource</CODE> causes <CODE>M3Conventions.PrimarySource</CODE> to be set in
the <CODE>fe_status</CODE> field of all the modules and interfaces that were
explicitly compiled (i.e. those in <CODE>interfaces</CODE> + <CODE>modules</CODE>).
<CODE>setCompTime = TRUE</CODE>, causes an <CODE>M3Conventions.CompTime</CODE> record to be created 
for each unit compiled, which will be passed to any <CODE>notify</CODE> methods. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
