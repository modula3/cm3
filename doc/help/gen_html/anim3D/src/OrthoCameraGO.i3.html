<P> An <CODE>OrthoCameraGO</CODE> is an orthographic camera, i.e. a camera which shows
   a scene as if it were infinitely far away --- lines that are parallel in
   the scene appear parallel in the image. The volume of space observed by
   such a camera forms a parallelopiped. The shape of the parallelopiped
   is determined by the camera position, its viewing direction, its up-vector,
   and the parallelopiped's height and width (which is determined by height
   and aspect ratio). The figure below illustrates the role of the parameters:
