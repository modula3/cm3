<P> A <CODE>PerspCameraGO.T</CODE> is a perspective camera, i.e.\ a camera which shows
   a scene from a certain point (and depicts perspective relations naturally).
   The volume of space observed by such a camera forms an (infinitely high)
   pyramid. The shape of the pyramid is determined by the following parameters:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item The position of the camera (which determines the tip of the pyramid)
   \item A point on the central viewing axis (which determines the vertical
         axis of the pyramid)
   \item The up-vector (which rotates the pyramid around its vertical axis)
   \item The field of vision (the angle between the ``up'' and the ``down''
         wall of the pyramid)
   \item The aspect ratio (the ratio between height and width of any
         cross-section of the pyramid)
   \end{itemize}
<P>
   The figure below illustrates the role of the parameters:

   <CODE>Fovy</CODE> is the name of a property that determines the field-of-vision,
   i.e.\ the angle (in degree radians) between the ``up'' and the ``down''

   \type{RealProp}{Val}. The angle between ``left'' and ``right'' wall is
   determined by the aspect ratio. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
