*************************************************************************
 A graph is an object represented as two lists of vertices and edges.
  Vertices and edges are both objects. They both carry some data (a
  REFANY) that can be used by other modules.
<P>
  From a vertex, one can access all the edges connected to it and also
  apply a procedure to all vertex neighbors.
  From an edge, one can access the vertices it connects (from, to). Edges
  are not oriented despite the identifiers.
<P>
  Apply methods allow browsing thought the vertices, the edges, or the neighbors
  of a given vertex.
  If the procedure that is passed to apply methods does deletions, it will do
  what you think, IF you delete only through the provided methods.
<P>
  Deletions methods are provided at the two levels: graph objects
  and vertices/edges objects. They are exactly the same.
<P>
  See test.m3 for as an example.
