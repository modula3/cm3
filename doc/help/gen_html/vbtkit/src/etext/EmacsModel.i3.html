</PRE> In the Emacs model, there is only a Primary selection. It is not
   an alias for either Source or Target.
<P>
   The model supports a single {\it region}, which is delimited by the
   {\it mark} and the {\it point}.  Control-space and control-@ set
   the mark; the point is the same as the current cursor position,
   which is changed by mouse-gestures, cursor-keys, or control-keys.
   When the region is established by cursor-keys or control-keys, it
   is not highlighted. If the region is highlighted, then any gesture
   that extends it will extend the highlighting as well.
<P>
   A single left-click sets the point and ensures that the current
   selection is not in replace-mode.  If you then drag the mouse, the
   location of the downclick becomes the mark, and the point is set to
   the current position of the mouse.  When the region is defined by
   dragging, it is highlighted. A double left-click sets both the mark
   and the point.
<P>
   The Cut and Copy commands make a copy of the text in the region
   (i.e., the Primary selection); it becomes the Source selection.
   Middle-click and meta-w call Copy.
<P>
   Right-click extends and highlights the current selection.
<P>
   The control- and meta-keys in the Emacs model are not
   case-sensitive; control-shift-a, for example, has the same effect
   as control-a.  The Emacs model supports ``Escape + character'' as
   an alternate way to type ``meta-character,'' and ISO Latin-1
   character composition. See Section~\ref{MetaOptionKeys} for an
   explanation of ``meta'' keys and composition.)
<P>
