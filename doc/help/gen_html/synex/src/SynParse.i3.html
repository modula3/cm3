     in frames; the Stack index which is the &quot;base&quot; of the current frame is

     definition of LL(1)). The result tree is the result tree of the successful
     branch (if any). Parsing fails if all the grammars in the list fail.

     Storage locations within the current frame, but one can write only to
     Storage locations larger than the largest one used when &quot;iter&quot; was
