<P> <CODE>RTHeapRep</CODE> is a private, implementation-dependent extension to
   <CODE>RTAllocator</CODE>, <CODE>RTCollector</CODE>, and <CODE>RTHeap</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>UNSAFE INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="#x1">RTHeapRep</A></interface>;
</PRE> This interface provides low-level access to the storage allocator and
   garbage collector.  Some items here should be made private or moved
   elsewhere. 

<P><PRE>IMPORT <A HREF="RT0.i3.html">RT0</A>, <A HREF="RTHeapDep.i3.html">RTHeapDep</A>;
FROM <A HREF="RT0.i3.html">RT0</A> IMPORT Typecode;
</PRE> The allocator and collector maintain two heaps of objects.  One heap is
   <CODE>traced</CODE> (its objects are collected); the other is <CODE>untraced</CODE>.
<P>
   The allocator for the untraced heap is simply <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  Unless
   explicitly noted, all procedures and variables here are for the traced
   heap.  Unless explicitly noted, none of the variables in this interface
   are writable. 

<P>***** PAGES *****

<P> The (traced) heap consists of a number of aligned pages, divided among
   three spaces: Free, Previous, and Current.  All other pages in the
   address space are in the <CODE>Unallocated</CODE> space.  Pages are numbered 0, 1,
   2, ....  The pagesize used is fixed; if incremental or generational
   collection is to be allowed, it must be at least the VM page size.
<P>
   The global variable p0 and p1 hold the bounds of the heap pages: only
   pages in the range [p0, p1) are in a space other than Unallocated.  For
   these pages, the array <CODE>desc</CODE> holds more information; desc[p - p0] holds
   state for page <CODE>p</CODE>.

</PRE>***** HEAP OBJECTS *****

<P> An object is a contiguous array of words on the heap.  The first word of
   an object is its header.  The object's body begins at the second word,
   its address is the object's REF.  All object bodies are aligned.
<P>
   <CODE>Small</CODE> objects never cross a page boundary.  <CODE>Large</CODE> objects are larger
   than a page; they span multiple contiguous pages.  For large objects,
   pages following the first are marked <CODE>continued</CODE>.  The large object is
   the only object on its pages; it starts at the beginning of its first
   page, and no other objects follow it on its last page.
<P>
   Special <CODE>filler</CODE> objects are used to exactly fill out the end of a page
   of small objects, or to fill space between small objects when they
   cannot exactly follow the previous object because of alignment
   restrictions.  There are 1-word and multi-word filler objects.  The
   beginning of a page is always adequate alignment, so a filler object
   need never begin a page. 

<P><PRE>TYPE

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> multi-word filler, the second word is the total size of the object,
   in bytes </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE>***** OPEN ARRAYS *****

<P> An open array object with N open dimensions contains a header, then a
   pointer to the first data element, then N integers that hold the
   dimensions. 

<P><PRE>TYPE ArrayShape = UNTRACED REF ARRAY [0 .. (*N-1*) 999] OF INTEGER;

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> if r is a reference to an open array, the number of open dimensions,

   runtime error to modify s^, to free s, or to use it after r has been
   garbage collected. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

   <CODE>NIL</CODE> is returned.  LL &gt;= RTOS.LockHeap. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> Objects in the traced heap are allocated from one of three <CODE>pools</CODE>.
   A pool is collection of pages with similar properties.  The <CODE>newPool</CODE>
   contains NEWed objects.  The <CODE>pureCopy</CODE> pool contains objects that
   were copied by the collector into new space, but that contain no
   internal REFs.  Similarly, the <CODE>impureCopy</CODE> pool is for copied
   objects that contain REFs.  

<P><PRE>TYPE

</PRE>***** MODULE OBJECTS *****

<P> A Modula-3 object is appears to the collector like any other object.
   The first word of its body is a pointer to its method list. 

<P><PRE>CONST MethodListOffset = 0;      (* byte offset in the object's body *)
</PRE> RegisterFinalCleanup is available for low-level cleanup by the thread
   package.  If <CODE>r</CODE> is registered for cleanup, then just before <CODE>r</CODE> is
   freed, the cleanup procedure <CODE>p</CODE> is called.  This procedure is allowed
   to dereference <CODE>r</CODE> to copy out data, not including traced references.
<P>
   Although the thread package could use ordinary weak refs, this operation
   is easy to provide and is a little more efficient.  The thread package
   cannot use weak refs straight on public types because its clients should
   remain free to use weak refs on subtypes. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTCollector.m3.html#RegisterFinalCleanup">RegisterFinalCleanup</A> (r: REFANY; p: PROCEDURE (r: REFANY));
