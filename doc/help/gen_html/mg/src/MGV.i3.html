         selector.select does low-level, element oriented selection.  It is
         called with v.mu locked and finds the element(s) that are
         selected.  The default selector returns the closest element, but
         other selectors could return the closest group, a group of the
         elements within some distance, the group containing the closest
         ellipse, etc.

         selectee.select handles the higher-level actions of the selection.
         It is called with whatever elements the selector returns.  It is
         normally view specific and handles the highlight actions
         associated with the selection and the input events to the

      Here are 2 potential Shape methods.  ShapeStretchy is the default
    </PRE>
for an MGV.T
<P>
   ShapeFixed returns a size range of {pref, pref, pref + 1}

   ShapeStretchy returns a size range of

   ReshapeLeaveOrigin leaves the MG graphical origin alone when

   that views that display themselves relative to the NW corner
   of the window or which set v.nw should use this reshape
   method.
