<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="#x1">Card</A></interface>;
</PRE> This interfaces paints and moves playing cards, in a way suitable for
   many kinds of solitaire games, and maybe other things.  The cards are
   all children of a provided ZSplit.
<P>
   The card layout is adjusted automatically when a card is detached from
   the top of a stack.  Attaching one card to the top of another stack of
   cards makes the new card the top of the stack, and positions the new
   card.  If the bottom-most card in the stack has value Min, the cards
   are stacked directly on top of one another.  Otherwise, the cards are
   stacked with a vertical spacing of Overlap if the card immediately
   underneath is face up, and OverlapDown if the card below is face down.
   A stack whose only elements have value Min, Max, or Talon paints as
   an empty card.  Almost always, you should have a Min, Max, or Talon
   at the bottom of a stack of cards.
<P>
   Game play proceeds when the user clicks on a card, or drags a card to
   another card.  The five procedures attachable, play, obvious, trivial,
   and stupid control the behavior.  The attachable procedure should return
   TRUE if the first card can be legally played on the second.  The play
   procedure should return TRUE, and set the out parameters, if there is
   a forced play.  The obvious, trivial, and stupid procedures are bound
   to clicking on the left, middle, and right buttons.  By convention, the
   obvious procedures offers a move for the selected card which, whether
   or not it is currently legal, would be progress towards solving the game.
   The trivial procedure suggests a legal move which isn't necessarily
   on the shortest path towards a solution, but may be a useful move if you
   can't think of anything else to do.  The stupid procedure suggests a
   move which is generally illegal, because it shows you what you might
   move onto this card to make progress.
<P>
   This interface always keeps a log of the moves that have been made.
   No standard user interface for undo and redo is provided, since in
   some games it might be considered cheating.
<P>
   In addition, the interface supports creating cards without stacking
   semantics, which can be used when rectangular cards are good enough.
   This is the type <CODE>Card</CODE>.
