<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="#x1">GraphVBT</A></interface>;
</PRE> A GraphVBT.T is a VBT class for constructing displays of graphs of
   vertices, edges, and polygons.  Alternatively, you can use it to display
   certain other data structures; for example, you can just use GraphVBT as
   a way to draw and move vertices on a VBT.
<P>
   There are operations to build a graph, and operations to update it
   (e.g., by moving vertices to new positions, automatically bringing their
   edges with them).  Many such updates can be animated, with objects
   slowly sliding toward their new positions, etc. 

<P> OBJECT CLASSES
<P>
   T.  A VBT class for displaying graph elements.
<P>
   Vertex.  A colored rectangle or ellipse with a textual label, with its
   center at specified coordinates.
<P>
   Edge.  A straight or curved colored line between a pair of vertices,
   with optional arrowheads.
<P>
   VertexHighlight.  A colored border on a vertex.
<P>
   Polygon.  A filled colored region specified by a path of vertices. 

<P> COORDINATES
<P>
   Each GraphVBT.T has a specified world coordinate system: [w..e]*[n..s],
   where (w, n) is the window's NW corner.  It is required that e # w, and
   that s # n.  It is allowed for e to be less than w, or s less than n, in
   which case the coordinate system changes handedness.
<P>
   All positions and sizes are given in world coordinates.
<P>
   The preferred size is the size of the graph vbt when it is first created.
   Any changes by the user to the size of the window take precedence.
   The world coordinate system is automatically scaled to fit the current
   size of the window and all objects and fonts are scaled appropriately.
<P>
   The display rectangle is centered in the window, bordered by at least
   the fixed margin.  Optionally, its size in pixels can be constrained to
   be a multiple of specified values horizontally and vertically; this can
   improve esthetics when the client deals with the corresponding fractions
   of world coordinates.  Also optionally, the display rectangle can be
   constrained to (approximately) a specified aspect ratio.
<P>
   If an element's coordinates lie outside the specified coordinate system,
   they are still mapped linearly onto the VBT, but they may be partially
   or completely invisible. 

<P> APPEARANCE
<P>
   The graph itself has a white (Bg) background.
<P>
   Each vertex is painted as a colored solid shape--a rectangle or an
   ellipse--with a colored textual label in a specified font, with its
   center at a specified coordinate position.  The client specifies the
   size and colors of the vertex.  The vertex has an optional inset border
   of a specified size and color.
<P>
   The actual point size of the font used to display the label is the
   closest available font size to the scaled world size.
<P>
   Edges are painted as colored lines connecting the centers of their
   vertices.  There is an optional arrowhead at each end; the size of the
   arrowhead is scaled with the width of the line.  Edges may be either
   straight lines or cubic Bezier curves.  If they are Beziers, the client
   specifies two additional vertices that act as control points.  If
   desired, these vertices can be zero-size and therefore invisible.
<P>
   Vertex highlights are painted as colored shapes that appear centered
   behind specified vertices, giving the appearance of a colored borders.
   The vertex highlight has the same shape as its vertex, and the same size
   plus a margin.  When a vertex highlight moves during an animation, the
   whole highlight appears when it is temporarily not behind any vertex.
<P>
   Polygons are painted as colored polygonal filled regions whose sides are
   straight and whose corners are the centers of specified vertices.  The
   handedness of the outline is ignored; it's always the interior of the
   polygon that is filled.
<P>
   When vertices are moved, their edges, polygons, and highlights move with
   them.
<P>
   On the display, vertexes appear in front of edges, edges in front of
   vertex highlights, and vertex highlights in front of polygons.  There is
   no other specified order of objects.  However, a vertex may be moved to
   the front or to the back of the other vertices, leaving the relative
   order of the others the same, and similarly for the other elements.  No
   other operations change the relative orders of objects on the display
   (except init and remove, of course). 

<P> ANIMATION
<P>
   Operations on objects in the graph may be either IMMEDIATE or ANIMATED,
   depending on the <CODE>animated</CODE> parameter.  (Some operations are always
   immediate due to implementation restrictions; others because animation
   would not make sense.)
<P>
   IMMEDIATE operations take place when invoked.  However, they may or may
   not appear on the screen immediately.  They can be forced to appear by
   calling the graph's <CODE>redisplay</CODE> method.
<P>
   The results of ANIMATED operations remain pending until the graph's
   <CODE>animate</CODE> method is invoked.  For example, if a vertex is moved in
   animated mode, the new position does not take effect immediately, but
   remains pending until the graph is animated.  At that time, all pending
   animated operations are performed over a specified time interval; a
   vertex will move in a smooth path from its current position to its final
   position, as will its highlights, polygons, and edges (including any
   Bezier curves for which it's a control point).
<P>
   Multiple moves without intervening animations overwrite each other.
<P>
   Animated operations normally maintain a pending STATE.  If a vertex is
   moved to one position and then another in the same animation, it slides
   directly to the final position during the animation.
<P>
   During an animation, elements normally takes straight paths from their
   initial positions to their new positions.  Optionally, an arbitrary path
   can be specified for a vertex; an optional AnimationPath object contains
   a method that maps a time during the animation (scaled to be between 0.0
   and 1.0) to the desired vertex position in world coordinates.  When a
   vertex follows such a path, so do any edge ends, highlights, corners of
   polygons, etc., that remain attached during the animation.  Otherwise,
   edge ends, vertex highlights, and corners of polygons follow straight
   paths to their final positions.
<P>
   There may be multiple animations per Zeus event.  Each animation starts
   at Zeus time t0 and ends at Zeus time t1.  (Zeus times are given in
   seconds but are scaled by Zeus.) For an event's first animation, t0
   should be 0; for subsequent animations for the same event, t0 should be
   the previous animation's t1.
<P>
   If t0 = t1, the animation appears to happen immediately.
<P>
   Animations may be aborted by a Thread.Alert on the thread that called
   graph.animate.  The animation checks for an alert at the end of each frame in
   the animation.


<P> LOCKING LEVELS
<P>
   Almost all methods in this interface have &lt;* LL.sup = graph.mu *&gt;.
<P>
   The <CODE>init</CODE> methods have &lt;* LL.sup &lt; graph.mu *&gt;.
<P>
   The <CODE>animate</CODE> method on graphs also has &lt;* LL.sup &lt; graph.mu *&gt;.
<P>
   The <CODE>redisplay</CODE> method on graphs has &lt;* LL.sup &lt;= VBT.mu *&gt;. 

<P> DESIGN DEFICIENCIES.
<P>
   No direct support for graphs.  For example, there is no operations to go
   from an adjacency matrix to a representation on the screen.
<P>
   No labels on edges.
<P>
   It is unclear how easily these method classes can be overridden by
   clients. 

<P> IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTIONS.
<P>
   The interface should not advertise that GraphVBT.T is a subtype of MG.V.
   This is a temporary workaround.
<P>
   Not all interesting operations can be animated.
<P>
   When edges move, their arrowheads may seem to float off and back on.
<P>
   Vertices' inset borders are drawn in fontColor, nor borderColor.
<P>
   The verticesAt/edgesAt/vertexHighlightsAt/polygonsAt operations have an
   internal model distinct from the actual renderer's, and sometimes return
   the wrong answers near boundaries.
<P>
   GraphVBT must be used under Zeus. 

<P> POSSIBLE ADDITIONS.
<P>
   Set coordinate system and margins.
<P>
   Edge highlights.
<P>
   Highlights <CODE>on top</CODE>.
<P>
   Group highlight.
<P>
   Callbacks for input events.
