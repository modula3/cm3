This report describes the design and implementation of a network
objects system, which allows you to write programs that communicate
over a network, while hiding the messy details of network programming.
Network objects provide functionality similar to remote procedure call (RPC),
but they are more general and easier to use.  The system is implemented
in Modula-3.

This book is an introductory programming text that uses Modula-3
for its examples. The authors say, "The main concern of the book is to
give a clean and comprehensive introduction to programming for
beginners of a computer science study. We start with more traditional
programming concepts and move toward advanced topics such as
object-oriented programming, parallel & concurrent programming,
exception handling, and persistent data techniques. The book also
presents a large number of complete examples written in Modula-3."

This article motivates and describes an optimizer for Modula-3
programs based on whole-program analysis. An optimizer that looks at
an entire program can do better than one that uses only the
information imported when compiling a single module. Preliminary
results are promising: on benchmark programs, up to 50% of method
invocations can be converted to direct calls. The optimizer is itself
written in Modula-3.

This paper shows how the overhead introduced by Modula-3's opaque
types can be reduced at link time. The optimizations described in the
paper are shown to be effective: they reduce the total number of

The paper evaluates Oberon, Modula-3, Sather, and Self in the context
of object-oriented programming. While each of these programming
languages provide support for classes with inheritance, dynamic
dispatch, code reuse, and information hiding, they do so in very
different ways and with varying levels of efficiency and simplicity. A
single application was coded in each language and the experience
gained forms the foundation on which the subjective critique is based.
By comparing the actual run-times of the various implementations it is
also possible to present an objective analysis of the efficiency of
the languages. Furthermore, by coding the application using both
explicit dynamic dispatch and static method binding, it is possible to
evaluate the cost of dynamic dispatch in each language. The
application was also coded in C++, thereby providing a well-known
baseline against which the execution times can be compared.
