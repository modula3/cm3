After you have built and shipped this package you will have
to define a quake variable to specify that you want to use this backend
during compiles.

You can define it on the command line thus
cm3 -DM3_BACKEND_MODE="StAloneLlvmAsm" 
or
cm3 -DM3_BACKEND_MODE="StAloneLlvmObj" 

The first one generates assember and adds the asseble step in the build
and the second one generates object code.

Having to specify the backend on each compile is cumbersome so you could
define the var M3_BACKEND_MODE in cm3.cfg in the base of your
install directory.

If you tend to use different backends a lot it may help to provide a
config file per backend and a short command to reset the main cm3.cfg
to whatever backend you intend to use.

You can check that you are using the llvm backend by compiling a short
program via
 cm3 -keep -commands
You should see the m3llvm and llc commands excuting and in the target
directory there will be files with .mb extensions.
To inspect the generated llvm IR just run
 llvm-dis file.mb
and view file.mb.ll in your editor.
