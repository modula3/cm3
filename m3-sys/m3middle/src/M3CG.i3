(*  Modula-3 code generator interface

This interface in conjunction with M3CG_Ops provides an intermediate
language for compiler front ends to generate Modula-3 procedures
and object modules.   Its primary client is the Modula-3 compiler.
The bulk of this interface was derived (i.e. stolen) from "M2CG" by
John Ellis and John DeTreville.

The intermediate language (this interface) allows for different actual
code generators, providing two degrees of freedom:

    - multiple target architectures
    - code generators optimized for different goals (code quality
      versus fast turn-around)

The interface to the intermediate language is procedural: clients call
methods to construct intermediate-language programs.  Thus a
fast-turn-around code generator can compile the intermediate language
on the fly without much consing, while a high-quality slower code
generator may construct an entire intermediate-language module before
compiling it.

This interface defines a single object type, M3CG.T.  The operations
available on an M3CG.T are defined in M3CG_Ops.
