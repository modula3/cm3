% HACK ALERT! THE FOLLOWING TWO FILES ARE DEPRECATED
% THEY ARE A MASSIVE HACK BECAUSE THE INTEGRATED BACK-END (m3back)
% CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION REGARDING TARGET INTEGER TYPES
% THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AS SOON AS SOMEONE CAN FIX m3back
%
% But first someone should explain what is the problem/hack/confusion here,
% and what it should be instead. The files are used to implement
% constant folding of up to 64bit integers, on a system potentially with
% only 32bit integers, very much like is done in m3front.
