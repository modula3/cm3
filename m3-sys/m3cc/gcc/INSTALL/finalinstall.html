<h1>Installing GCC: Final installation</h1>
Now that GCC has been built (and optionally tested), you can install it with
<br><pre>cd <var>objdir</var>; make install
</pre>

<p>We strongly recommend to install into a target directory where there is
no previous version of GCC present.

<p>That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
be found in <code><var>prefix</var>/bin</code> where <var>prefix</var> is the value you
specified with the <code>--prefix</code> to configure (or <code>/usr/local</code>
by default).  (If you specified <code>--bindir</code>, that directory will
be used instead; otherwise, if you specified <code>--exec-prefix</code>,
<code><var>exec-prefix</var>/bin</code> will be used.)  Headers for the C++ and
Java libraries are installed in <code><var>prefix</var>/include</code>; libraries
in <code><var>libdir</var></code> (normally <code><var>prefix</var>/lib</code>); internal
parts of the compiler in <code><var>libdir</var>/gcc-lib</code>; documentation in
info format in <code><var>infodir</var></code> (normally <code><var>prefix</var>/info</code>).

<p>If you built a released version of GCC using <code>make bootstrap</code> then please
quickly review the build status page for
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.1/buildstat.html">3.1</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0/buildstat.html">3.0</a>, or
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/buildstat.html">2.95</a>. 
If your system is not listed for the version of GCC that you built,
send a note to
<a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> indicating
that you successfully built and installed GCC. 
Include the following information:

<ul>
<li>Output from running <code><var>srcdir</var>/config.guess</code>.  Do not send us
that file itself, just the one-line output from running it.

<li>The output of <code>gcc -v</code> for your newly installed gcc. 
This tells us which version of GCC you built and the options you passed to
configure.

<li>Whether you enabled all languages or a subset of them.  If you used a
full distribution then this information is part of the configure
options in the output of <code>gcc -v</code>, but if you downloaded the
"core" compiler plus additional front ends then it isn't apparent
which ones you built unless you tell us about it.

<li>If the build was for GNU/Linux, also include:
<ul>
<li>The distribution name and version (e.g., Red Hat 7.1 or Debian 2.2.3);
this information should be available from <code>/etc/issue</code>.

<li>The version of the Linux kernel, available from <code>uname --version</code>
or <code>uname -a</code>.

<li>The version of glibc you used; for RPM-based systems like Red Hat,
Mandrake, and SuSE type <code>rpm -q glibc</code> to get the glibc version,
and on systems like Debian and Progeny use <code>dpkg -l libc6</code>. 
</ul>
For other systems, you can include similar information if you think it is
relevant.

<li>Any other information that you think would be useful to people building
GCC on the same configuration.  The new entry in the build status list
will include a link to the archived copy of your message. 
</ul>

<p>We'd also like to know if the
<a href="specific.html">host/target specific installation notes</a>
didn't include your host/target information or if that information is
incomplete or out of date.  Send a note to
<a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> telling us how the information should be changed.

<p>If you find a bug, please report it following our
<a href="../bugs.html">bug reporting guidelines</a>.

<p>If you want to print the GCC manuals, do <code>cd <var>objdir</var>; make
dvi</code>.  You will need to have <code>texi2dvi</code> (version at least 4.1)
and TeX installed.  This creates a number of <code>.dvi</code> files in
subdirectories of <code><var>objdir</var></code>; these may be converted for
printing with programs such as <code>dvips</code>.  You can also
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/order.html">buy printed manuals from the Free Software Foundation</a>, though such manuals may not be for the most
recent version of GCC.
