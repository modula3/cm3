#  -e 's|/$$||'          match a trailing forward slash and eliminates it
#  -e 's|^[^/]|/|'       forces the string to start with a forward slash (*)
#  -e 's|/[^/]*|../|g'   replaces each occurrence of /<directory> with ../
#
# (*) Note this pattern overwrites the first character of the string
# with a forward slash if one is not already present.  This is not a
# problem because the exact names of the sub-directories concerned is
# unimportant, just the number of them matters.

# -----------------------------
# Rebuilding this configuration
# -----------------------------

# On the use of stamps:
# Consider the example of tree-check.h. It is constructed with build/gencheck.
# A simple rule to build tree-check.h would be
# tree-check.h: build/gencheck$(build_exeext)
#	$(RUN_GEN) build/gencheck$(build_exeext) > tree-check.h
#
# but tree-check.h doesn't change every time gencheck changes. It would the
# nice if targets that depend on tree-check.h wouldn't be rebuild
# unnecessarily when tree-check.h is unchanged. To make this, tree-check.h
# must not be overwritten with a identical copy. One solution is to use a
# temporary file
# tree-check.h: build/gencheck$(build_exeext)
#	$(RUN_GEN) build/gencheck$(build_exeext) > tmp-check.h
#	$(SHELL) $(srcdir)/../move-if-change tmp-check.h tree-check.h
#
# This solution has a different problem. Since the time stamp of tree-check.h
# is unchanged, make will try to update tree-check.h every time it runs.
# To prevent this, one can add a stamp
# tree-check.h: s-check
# s-check : build/gencheck$(build_exeext)
#	$(RUN_GEN) build/gencheck$(build_exeext) > tmp-check.h
#	$(SHELL) $(srcdir)/../move-if-change tmp-check.h tree-check.h
#	$(STAMP) s-check
#
# The problem with this solution is that make thinks that tree-check.h is
# always unchanged. Make must be deceived into thinking that tree-check.h is
# rebuild by the "tree-check.h: s-check" rule. To do this, add a dummy command:
# tree-check.h: s-check; @true
# s-check : build/gencheck$(build_exeext)
#	$(RUN_GEN) build/gencheck$(build_exeext) > tmp-check.h
#	$(SHELL) $(srcdir)/../move-if-change tmp-check.h tree-check.h
#	$(STAMP) s-check
#
# This is what is done in this makefile. Note that mkconfig.sh has a
# move-if-change built-in
