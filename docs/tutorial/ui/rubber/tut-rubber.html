<h3>Rubber banding</h3>

The program
<a href="./Rubber.m3">Rubber.m3</a>
shows how to do rubber banding.
Rubber banding is frequently used to
select a rectangular region of a VBT.
The mouse and position 
methods play an important role in rubber banding. So we need to understand
these methods first.
<p>

A <code>mouse</code> method is called by Trestle whenever there is a mouse event;
i.e., when a mouse button is pressed or released.
The second parameter to the <code>mouse</code> method contains information about the
mouse event such as which button was involved and
whether it was pressed or released.
Using this information, we can do some action in response to a 
particular mouse event.
<p>

A position method is called by Trestle whenever the mouse leaves
the cage of the VBT.
A cage is a set of cursor positions.
The cage of a
VBT can be set to contain a single position, a rectangle of positions
inside a VBT, all of the positions in a VBT, or all of the positions
outside a VBT.
<p>

The application program
<a href="./Rubber.m3">Rubber.m3</a>
a simple leaf VBT.
A rectangular portion of the VBT can be selected by pressing
a mouse button down and dragging the cursor to the opposite
corner of the area.
When the button is pressed the current position,
the first corner of the area, is saved.
Each time the cursor is moved a new rectangle is drawn showing
the area between the saved corner and the current position.
When the button is released the second corner is saved.
Nothing is done with the region.
The last rectangle is not even erased,
although normally it is no longer important.
The rectangle is not redrawn, even if the
application is revealed after being covered by another application.
The <code>repaint</code> procedure would be responsible for maintaining the
appearance of the selected region
if, for example, it were to be redrawn or displayed in a different color.
The following images
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../rubber/rubber1.gif">Rubber 1
  <li> <img src="../rubber/rubber2.gif">Rubber 2
</ul>
depict two different views of the application,
although there is not much to see.
Two views are shown each with a different rectangle.
The cursor is not shown in these figures.
<p>

The <code>PaintOp.Swap</code>
operation is used to draw and erase the rectangle.
The swap operation ensures that original pixels on the path are restored when
the path is erased.

To implement rubber banding four things are done in the mouse method.
<ol>
  <li> Set a flag to indicate that the rubber banding has begun.
  <li> Start a new rubber banding path.
  <li> Save the cursor position.
  <li> Set the VBT's cage to the current cursor position so that Trestle calls
       the position method when the mouse leaves the current position.
</ol>
<p>

The following actions are done in the position method if rubber banding
is currently taking place.
<ol>
  <li> Erase the previous rubber banding path if it exists.
  <li> Build a new rectangular path using the current position as one corner.
  <li> Draw the path.
  <li> Set the VBT's cage to contain only the current cursor position. This
       makes Trestle call position method again as soon as the cursor leaves the
       current position.
</ol>
