<h3>Displaying text</h3>

The program
<a href="./Main.m3">Main.m3</a>
illustrates some of the many possible variations
concerning the display of text on the screen.
The text to appear is just one of many options for <code>TextVBT</code>;
some of the others are margins, fonts, color and alignment.
<p>

The default horizontal alignment and vertical alignment is 0.5.
This means that the text is centered inside the rectangular window.
To get left justification the setting of <code>halign</code> is 0.0.
The default font is <code>Font.Builtin</code>.
Other fonts can be chosen using <code>Font.FromName</code>,
assuming that they are available from the X Window System.
By default, the foreground and background colors of the text
are white and black,
but different colors are possible.
A <code>TextVBT</code> requires that the colors be specified
by a collection of four painting operations called a <code>ColorQuad</code>.
The most common collection requires specifying the foreground and
background colors that should be used in the ``painting'' of the text VBT.
This collection is constructed using the <code>MakeColorQuad</code> function.
The colors themselves are specified by their red/green/blue components.
<p>

The program
<a href="./Main.m3">Main.m3</a>
uses characters from the ISO Latin-1 character set.
Character names, for instance, the upside down question mark
and the ``e'' with the acute accent, can be obtained from the
module <code>Latin1Key</code>.
This module is part of the standard Modula-3 distribution and plays
no particular role in Trestle.
The constants in <code>Latin1Key</code> can be used to select
the correct character from the 8-bit, discrete type <code>CHAR</code>.

The following images
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../text/text1.gif">Text 1
  <li> <img src="../text/text2.gif">Text 2
  <li> <img src="../text/text3.gif">Text 3
</ul>
contain three views of the window created by the Trestle program.
The background color is blue and the letters are written in white.
The first view shows approximately what the window looks like when
it is first mapped by the X Window system.
The other two show what happens when the window is resized
by the window manager.
The position of the text is governed by the horizonal and vertical
alignment parameters.
Since <code>ha</code> is 0.0, the text is left justified.
Since <code>va</code> is 0.4, the text is slightly above the center of window.
