and Running Programs</a></h1>

<p>You can divide large Modula-3 programs into multiple <i>packages</i>.
A package is a collection of a interfaces and modules. The Modula-3 convention
is to have each package reside in its own directory, with sources included
in an <i><tt>src</tt></i> subdirectory, and a <i><tt>build </tt></i>directory,
which contains all the files that are generated in the process of building
your program. For example, a package '<tt>List'</tt> residing in the directory
<tt>/proj/harry/m3</tt> would contain source code in the directory <tt>/proj/harry/m3/List/src</tt>,
and on a SunOS 4.1 running on Sparcs, the build directory would be <tt>/proj/harry/m3/List/SPARC</tt>.
</p>

<p>The advantages of this distinction of source and derived files are two-folds:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can easily distinguish source files for backup, revision control,
etc.</li>

<li>You can share the same cross-mounted project tree across operating
systems, and architectures, without having to hassle with object files.</li>
</ul>

<p>This, combined with Modula-3's multi-platform libraries, simplify the
management of large, multi-platform programs.</p>

<h4>
<hr width="100%" >Building Programs</h4>

<p>The easiest way to build Modula-3 programs is using the CM3-IDE user
interface. Using CM3-IDE is as easy as browsing web pages. All you have
to do is to find yourself to the project you are working on by selecting
the &quot;Private Packages&quot; link from the CM3-IDE front page. Once
at a private package, you can easily browse through files, and build, clean,
and ship programs. It is as easy as using the web browser!</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may use the Critical Mass Modula-3 compiler from
the command line, via issuing the &quot;<tt>cm3</tt>&quot; command in an
package directory. CM&nbsp;Modula-3 will automatically scan your package
and build it with or without an m3makefile.</p>
