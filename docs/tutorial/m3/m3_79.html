<H3><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="m3_toc.html#SEC79">Lex Interface</A></H3>
<P>
The Lex interface provides procedures for reading strings, booleans,
integers, and floating-point numbers from an input stream.  Similar
functionality on text strings is available from the "Scan" module
(see section <A HREF="m3_73.html#SEC73">Scan Interface</A>).
<P>
The following constant sets are provided to define what characters Lex
considers 'blank' and 'nonblank':
<PRE>
CONST
   Blanks = SET OF CHAR{
     ' ', '\t', '\n', '\r', '\013'  vertical tab , '\f'};
   NonBlanks = SET OF CHAR{'!' .. '~'};
</PRE>
<P>
Each of the procedures in this interface reads a sequence of characters
from the reader passed to the procedure, and leaves the reader
positioned immediately after that sequence, perhaps at end-of-file.  You
may not use Rd.UnGetChar() after calling any of these routines.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>PROCEDURE Scan(rd: Rd.T; READONLY cs: SET OF CHAR := NonBlanks): TEXT<BR> RAISES {Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD><DT><TT>PROCEDURE Skip(rd: Rd.T; READONLY cs: SET OF CHAR := Blanks)<BR> RAISES {Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD>Read characters until one is found that is not in the character set "cs"
or EOF is reached.  <CODE>Scan</CODE> returns characters read up but not
including the terminating character; <CODE>Skip</CODE> discards them.

A common task in processing data from a reader involves throwing away
blanks.  This can be accomplished with the call "Lex.Skip(rd, Blanks)"
or just "Lex.Skip(rd)".

<DT><TT>PROCEDURE Match(rd: Rd.T; t: TEXT) RAISES {Error, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD>Read the longest sequence of characters from "rd" that matches the
sequence of characters in "t".  Raise "Error" if "t" is not completely
matched.

<DT><TT>PROCEDURE Bool(rd: Rd.T): BOOLEAN RAISES {Error, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD>Read a boolean from "rd" and return its value. 

"Bool" skips blanks, then reads the longest sequence of "rd" that is
a sequence of a "Boolean" in the following grammar:

| Boolean = "F" "A" "L" "S" "E" | "T" "R" "U" "E".

The case of letters in a "Boolean" is not significant.  If the
character sequence read from "rd" is an entire "Boolean", "Bool" returns that
boolean; else it raises "Error".  

<DT><TT>PROCEDURE Int(rd: Rd.T; defaultBase: [2..16] := 10)<BR> : INTEGER RAISES {Error, FloatMode.Trap, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD><DT><TT>PROCEDURE Unsigned(rd: Rd.T; defaultBase: [2..16] := 16)<BR> : Word.T RAISES {Error, FloatMode.Trap, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD>
Read a number from "rd" and return its value. 

<DT><TT>PROCEDURE Real(rd: Rd.T): REAL<BR> RAISES {Error, FloatMode.Trap, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD><DT><TT>PROCEDURE LongReal(rd: Rd.T): LONGREAL<BR> RAISES {Error, FloatMode.Trap, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD><DT><TT>PROCEDURE Extended(rd: Rd.T): EXTENDED<BR> RAISES {Error, FloatMode.Trap, Rd.Failure, Alerted};</TT>
<DD>
Read a real number from "rd" and return its value.
