<p>An <tt>Rd.T</tt> (or &quot;reader&quot;) is a character input stream.
The basic operation on a reader is &quot;GetChar&quot;, which returns the
source character at the current position and advances the current position
by one. Some readers are <i>seekable</i>, which means that they also allow
setting the current position anywhere in the source. For example, readers
from random access files are seekable; readers from terminals and sequential
files are not. </p>

<pre>EXCEPTION EndOfFile; Failure(AtomList.T); 
</pre>

<p>Since there are many classes of readers, there are many ways that a
reader can break--for example, the connection to a terminal can be broken,
the disk can signal a read error, etc. All problems of this sort are reported
by raising the exception &quot;Failure&quot;. The documentation of a reader
class should specify what failures the class can raise and how they are
encoded in the argument to &quot;Failure&quot;. </p>

<p>Illegal operations cause a checked runtime error. </p>

<dl COMPACT>
<dt><tt>PROCEDURE GetChar(rd: T): CHAR RAISES {EndOfFile, Failure, Alerted};</tt>
</dt>

<dd>Return the next character from &quot;rd&quot;. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE EOF(rd: T): BOOLEAN RAISES {Failure, Alerted};</tt> </dt>

<dd>Return &quot;TRUE&quot; iff &quot;rd&quot; is at end-of-file. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE UnGetChar(rd: T);</tt> </dt>

<dd>&quot;Push back&quot; the last character read from &quot;rd&quot;,
so that the next call to &quot;GetChar&quot; will read it again. &quot;UnGetChar(rd)&quot;
is guaranteed to work only if &quot;GetChar(rd)&quot; was the last operation
on &quot;rd&quot;. Thus &quot;UnGetChar&quot; cannot be called twice in
a row, or after &quot;Seek&quot; or &quot;EOF&quot;. If this rule is violated,
a checked runtime error may result. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE CharsReady(rd: T): CARDINAL RAISES {Failure};</tt> </dt>

<dd>Return some number of characters that can be read without indefinite
waiting. The &quot;end of file marker&quot; counts as one character for
this purpose, so &quot;CharsReady&quot; will return 1, not 0, if &quot;EOF(rd)&quot;
is true. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE GetSub(rd: T; VAR (*OUT*) str: ARRAY OF CHAR)
<br>: CARDINAL RAISES {Failure, Alerted};</tt> </dt>

<dd>Read from &quot;rd&quot; into &quot;str&quot; until &quot;rd&quot;
is exhausted or &quot;str&quot; is filled. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE GetSubLine(rd: T; VAR (*OUT*) str: ARRAY OF CHAR)
<br>: CARDINAL RAISES {Failure, Alerted};</tt> </dt>

<dd>Read from &quot;rd&quot; into &quot;str&quot; until a newline is read,
&quot;rd&quot; is exhausted, or &quot;str&quot; is filled. The newline
character is not stripped out. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE GetText(rd: T; len: CARDINAL): TEXT RAISES {Failure,
Alerted};</tt> </dt>

<dd>Read from &quot;rd&quot; until it is exhausted or &quot;len&quot; characters
have been read, and return the result as a &quot;TEXT&quot;. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE GetLine(rd: T): TEXT RAISES {EndOfFile, Failure, Alerted};</tt>
</dt>

<dd>If &quot;EOF(rd)&quot; then raise &quot;EndOfFile&quot;. Otherwise,
read characters until a line break is read or &quot;rd&quot; is exhausted,
and return the result as a &quot;TEXT&quot;---but discard the line break
if it is present. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Seek(rd: T; n: CARDINAL) RAISES {Failure, Alerted};</tt>
</dt>

<dd>If &quot;rd&quot; is seekable, makes the current position := MIN(n,
len(rd)). </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Close(rd: T) RAISES {Failure, Alerted};</tt> </dt>

<dd>If &quot;rd&quot; is not already closed, release any resources associated
with &quot;rd&quot; and set &quot;closed(rd) := TRUE&quot;. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Index(rd: T): CARDINAL;</tt> </dt>

<dd>Returns the current position of &quot;rd&quot;. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Length(rd: T): INTEGER RAISES {Failure, Alerted};</tt>
</dt>

<dd>Returns the total number of characters in &quot;rd&quot;. If &quot;len(rd)&quot;
is unknown to the implementation of an intermittent reader, &quot;Length(rd)&quot;
returns -1. </dd>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Intermittent(rd: T): BOOLEAN;</tt> </dt>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Seekable(rd: T): BOOLEAN;</tt> </dt>

<dt><tt>PROCEDURE Closed(rd: T): BOOLEAN;</tt> </dt>

<dd>Return &quot;intermittent(rd)&quot;, &quot;seekable(rd)&quot;, and
&quot;closed(rd)&quot;, respectively. These can be applied to closed readers.
</dd>
