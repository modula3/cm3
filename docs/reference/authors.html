<H2>About the authors</H2>

<P>
Luca Cardelli was an undergraduate in Pisa and has a Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the University of Edinburgh (1982).  He worked at AT&T
Bell Labs, Murray Hill, from 1982 to 1985 before assuming his current
position at DEC SRC.  His main interests are in constructive logic,
type theory, and language design and implementation.

<P>
Jim Donahue received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University
of Toronto (1975).  He was an Assistant Professor at Cornell University
from 1975 to 1981.  In 1981, he joined the Computer Science Laboratory
of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  In 1986, he established the
Olivetti Research Center and was its Director until 1990.  He is now
a Senior Scientist and Product Manager for Teknekron Software Systems.
His interests include programming language design, distributed system
design, and database systems and applications.

<P>
Lucille Glassman is a technical writer for DEC SRC.

<P>
Mick Jordan has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of
Cambridge.  From 1984 to 1988 he worked at the Acorn Research Center
in Palo Alto on a programming environment for Modula-2+.  Before joining
DEC SRC in 1990 he was at Olivetti Research, where he led the group
that produced the Olivetti Modula-3 implementation.  His principal
current interest is in programming tools that are based on Modula-3
Abstract Syntax Trees.

<P>
Bill Kalsow received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University
of Wisconsin at Madison (1986).  Since then he has worked as DEC SRC.
His primary interests are programming languages and their
implementations.

<P>
Greg Nelson got his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1980, where he worked on
program verification and algorithms for mechanical theorem proving.
He was the author of the Juno constraint-based graphics system at Xerox
PARC's Computer Science Laboratory, has taught at Princeton University,
and is now a member of DEC SRC.  Currently his active interests are
window systems, programming language design, and the semantic theory
of guarded commands.
