<H2>Procedure types</H2>
<P>

A <EM>procedure</EM> is either <TT>NIL</TT> or a triple consisting of:
<UL>
<LI> the <EM>body</EM>, which is a statement, 
<LI> the <EM>signature</EM>, which specifies the procedure's formal arguments,
     result type, and raises set (the set of exceptions that
     the procedure can raise), 
<LI> the <EM>environment</EM>, which is the scope with respect to which
     variable names in the body will be interpreted.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.55>A</A>
procedure that returns a result is called a <EM>function procedure</EM>;
a procedure that does not return a result is called a
<EM>proper procedure</EM>.
A <EM>top-level</EM> procedure is a procedure declared in the outermost scope
of a module.  Any other procedure is a <EM>local</EM> procedure.  
A local procedure can be passed as a parameter but not assigned, since
in a stack implementation a local procedure becomes invalid when the
frame for the procedure containing it is popped.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.56>A</A>
<EM>procedure constant</EM> is an identifier declared as a procedure.
(As opposed to a procedure variable, which is a variable declared
with a procedure type.)
<P>

A procedure type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = PROCEDURE sig
</PRE>
<A NAME=idx.57>where</A>
<TT>sig</TT> is a signature specification, which has the form:
<PRE>
    (formal_1; ...; formal_n): R RAISES S
</PRE>
where
<UL>
<LI> Each <TT>formal_i</TT> is a formal parameter declaration, as
     described below.
<LI> <TT>R</TT> is the result type, which can be any type but an
     open array type.  The "<TT>: R</TT>" can be omitted, making the signature
     that of a proper procedure.
<LI> <TT>S</TT> is the raises set, which is either an explicit
     set of exceptions with the syntax <TT>{E_1, ..., E_n}</TT>, or
     the symbol <TT>ANY</TT> representing the set of all exceptions.
     If "<TT>RAISES S</TT>" is omitted, "<TT>RAISES {}</TT>" is assumed.
</UL>
<P>

A formal parameter declaration has the form
<PRE>
    Mode Name: Type := Default
</PRE>
<A NAME=idx.58>where</A>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>Mode</TT> is a parameter mode, which can be <TT>VALUE</TT>,
     <TT>VAR</TT>, or <TT>READONLY</TT>.  If <TT>Mode</TT> is omitted,
     it defaults to <TT>VALUE</TT>.
<LI> <TT>Name</TT> is an identifier that names the parameter.
     The parameter names must be distinct.
<LI> <TT>Type</TT> is the type of the parameter.
<LI> <TT>Default</TT> is a constant expression, the default value
     for the parameter.  If <TT>Mode</TT> is <TT>VAR</TT>,
     "<TT>:= Default</TT>" must be omitted, otherwise either
     "<TT>:= Default</TT>" or "<TT>  : Type</TT>" can be omitted,
     but not both.  If <TT>Type</TT> is omitted, it is taken to be
     the type of <TT>Default</TT>.  If both are present,
     the value of <TT>Default</TT> must be a member of <TT>Type</TT>.
</UL>
<P>

When a series of parameters share the same mode, type, and default,
<TT>name_i</TT> can be a list of identifiers separated by commas.  Such
a list is shorthand for a list in which the mode, type, and
default are repeated for each identifier.  That is:
<PRE>
    Mode v_1, ..., v_n: Type := Default
</PRE>
is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    Mode v_1: Type := Default; ...; Mode v_n: Type := Default
</PRE>
<P>

This shorthand is eliminated from the expanded definition of the type.  
The default values are included.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.59>A</A>
procedure value <TT>P</TT> is a member of the type <TT>T</TT>
if it is <TT>NIL</TT>
or its signature is <EM>covered</EM> by the signature of <TT>T</TT>, where
<TT>signature_1</TT> covers <TT>signature_2</TT> if:
<UL>
<LI> They have the same number of parameters, and corresponding parameters
     have the same type and mode.
<LI> They have the same result type, or neither has a result type.
<LI> The raises set of <TT>signature_1</TT> contains the raises
     set of <TT>signature_2</TT>.
</UL>
<P>

The parameter names and defaults affect the type of a procedure, but
not its value.  For example, consider the declarations:
<PRE>
    PROCEDURE P(txt: TEXT := "P") = 
      BEGIN
        Wr.PutText(Stdio.stdout, txt)
      END P;

    VAR q: PROCEDURE(txt: TEXT := "Q") := P;
</PRE>
Now <TT>P = q</TT> is <TT>TRUE</TT>, yet <TT>P()</TT> prints "<TT>P</TT>"
and <TT>q()</TT> prints "<TT>Q</TT>". The interpretation of defaulted
parameters is determined by a procedure's type, not its value; the
assignment <TT>q := P</TT> changes <TT>q</TT>'s value, not its type.
<P>

Examples of procedure types:
<PRE>
    TYPE
      Integrand = PROCEDURE (x: REAL): REAL;
      Integrator = PROCEDURE(f: Integrand; lo, hi: REAL): REAL;

      TokenIterator = PROCEDURE(VAR t: Token) RAISES {TokenError};

      RenderProc = PROCEDURE(
        scene: REFANY;
        READONLY t: Transform := Identity)
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.60>In</A>
a procedure type, <TT>RAISES</TT> binds to the closest preceding 
<TT>PROCEDURE</TT>.
That is, the parentheses are required in:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = PROCEDURE (): (PROCEDURE ()) RAISES {}
</PRE>
