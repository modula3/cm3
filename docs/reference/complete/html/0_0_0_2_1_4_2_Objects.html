<P>
The better we understand our programs, the bigger the building blocks we use
to structure them.  After the instruction came the statement, after the
statement came the procedure, after the procedure came the interface.  The
next step seems to be the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">abstract type</SPAN>.

<P>
At the theoretical level, an abstract type is a type defined by the
specifications of its operations instead of by the representation of its data.
As realized in modern programming languages, a value of an abstract type is
represented by an ``object'' whose operations are implemented by a suite of
procedure values called the object's ``methods''.  A new object type can be
defined as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">subtype</SPAN> of an existing type, in which case the new type
has all the methods of the old type, and possibly new ones as well
(inheritance).  The new type can provide new implementations for the old
methods (overriding).

<P>
Objects were invented in the mid-sixties by the farsighted designers of Simula
[Birtwistle].  Objects in Modula-3 are very much like objects in Simula: they
are always references, they have both data fields and methods, and they have
single inheritance but not multiple inheritance.

<P>
Small examples are often used to get across the basic idea: truck as a subtype
of vehicle; rectangle as a subtype of polygon.  Modula-3 aims at larger
systems that illustrate how object types provide structure for large programs.
In Modula-3 the main design effort is concentrated into specifying the
properties of a single abstract type--a stream of characters, a window on the
screen.  Then dozens of interfaces and modules are coded that provide useful
subtypes of the central abstraction.  The abstract type provides the blueprint
for a whole family of interfaces and modules.  If the central abstraction is
well-designed then useful subtypes can be produced easily, and the original
design cost will be repaid with interest.

<P>
The combination of object types with Modula-2 opaque types produces something
new: the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">partially opaque type</SPAN>, where some of an object's fields are
visible in a scope and others are hidden.  Because the committee had no
experience with partially opaque types, the first version of Modula-3
restricted them severely; but after a year of experience it was clear that
they were a good thing, and the language was revised to remove the
restrictions.

<P>
It is possible to use object-oriented techniques even in languages that were
not designed to support them, by explicitly allocating the data records and
method suites.  This approach works reasonably smoothly when there are no
subtypes; however it is through subtyping that object-oriented techniques
offer the most leverage.  The approach works badly when subtyping is needed:
either you allocate the data records for the different parts of the object
individually (which is expensive and notationally cumbersome) or you must rely
on unchecked type transfers, which is unsafe.  Whichever approach is taken,
the subtype relations are all in the programmer's head: only with an
object-oriented language is it possible to get object-oriented static
typechecking.
