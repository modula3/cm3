<H2>Modules and interfaces</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
Art, it seems to me, should simplify.  That, indeed, is very nearly
the whole of the higher artistic process; finding what conventions
of form and what detail one can do without and yet preserve the spirit
of the whole.

<A NAME=idx.134>A</A>
<EM>module</EM> is like a block, except for the visibility of names.  
An entity is visible in a block if it is declared in the block 
or in some enclosing block; an entity is visible in a module if 
it is declared in the module or in an interface that is imported 
or exported by the module.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.135>An</A>
<EM>interface</EM> is a group of declarations.  Declarations in
interfaces are the same as in blocks, except that any variable
initializations must be constant, and procedure declarations must specify
only the signature, not the body.
<P>

A module <TT>X</TT> <EM>exports</EM> an interface <TT>I</TT> to supply bodies
for one or more of the procedures declared in the interface.  A module
or interface <TT>X</TT> <EM>imports</EM> an interface <TT>I</TT> to make the
entities declared in <TT>I</TT> visible in <TT>X</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.136>A</A>
<EM>program</EM> is a collection of modules and interfaces that contains
every interface imported or exported by any of its modules or
interfaces, and in which no procedure, module, or interface is multiply
defined.  The effect of executing a program is to execute the bodies
of each of its modules.  The order of execution of the modules is
constrained by the <A HREF="init.html#idx.148">initialization rule</A>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.137>The</A>
module whose body is executed last is called the <EM>main module</EM>.
Implementations are expected to provide a way to specify the main
module, in case the initialization rule does not determine it uniquely.
The recommended rule is that the main module be the one that exports
the interface <TT>Main</TT>, whose contents are implementation-dependent.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.138>Program</A>
execution terminates when the body of the main module
terminates, even if concurrent threads of control are still executing.
<P>

The names of the modules and interfaces of a program are called
<EM>global</EM> names.  The method for looking up global names---for example,
by file system search paths---is implementation-dependent.
