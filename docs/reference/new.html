<H2>New</H2>
<P>

An allocation operation has the form:
<PRE>
    NEW(T, ...)
</PRE>
where <TT>T</TT> is a reference type other than <TT>REFANY</TT>,
<TT>ADDRESS</TT>, or <TT>NULL</TT>.  The operation returns the address of a
newly-allocated variable of <TT>T</TT>'s referent type; or if <TT>T</TT>
is an object type, a newly-allocated data record paired with a method
suite.  The reference returned by <TT>NEW</TT> is distinct from all
existing references.  The allocated type of the new reference is <TT>T</TT>.
<P>

It is a static error if <TT>T</TT>'s referent type is empty.
If <TT>T</TT> is declared as an opaque type,
<TT>NEW(T)</TT> is legal only in scopes
where <TT>T</TT>'s concrete type is known completely,
or is known to be an object type.
<P>

The initial state of the referent generally represents an arbitrary 
value of its type.  If <TT>T</TT> is an object type or a reference to 
a record or open array then <TT>NEW</TT> takes additional arguments 
to control the initial state of the new variable.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.180>If</A>
<TT>T</TT> is a reference to an array with k open dimensions, the 
<TT>NEW</TT> operation has the form:
<PRE>
    NEW(T, n_1, ..., n_k)
</PRE>
where the <TT>n</TT>'s are integer-valued expressions that specify the 
lengths of the new array in its first k dimensions.  The values in 
the array will be arbitrary values of their type.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.181>If</A>
<TT>T</TT> is an object type or a reference to a record, the <TT>NEW</TT> 
operation has the form:
<PRE>
    NEW(T, Bindings)
</PRE>
where <TT>Bindings</TT> is a list of keyword bindings used to initialize
the new fields.  Positional bindings are not allowed.
<P>

Each binding <TT>f := v</TT> initializes the field <TT>f</TT> to the value
<TT>v</TT>.  Fields for which no binding is supplied will be initialized
to their
<A HREF="records.html#idx.45">defaults</A>
if they have defaults; otherwise they will be
initialized to arbitrary values of their types.
<P>

The order of the field bindings makes no difference.
<P>

If <TT>T</TT> is an object type then <TT>Bindings</TT> can also include
method overrides of the form <TT>m := P</TT>, where <TT>m</TT> is a method
of <TT>T</TT> and <TT>P</TT> is a top-level procedure constant.  This is
syntactic sugar for the allocation of a subtype of <TT>T</TT> that includes
the given overrides, in the given order.
For example, <TT>NEW(T, m := P)</TT> is sugar for
<PRE>
    NEW(T OBJECT OVERRIDES m := P END).
</PRE>
