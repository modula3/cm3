<H2>Unsafe operations</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
There are some cases that no law can be framed to cover.

<P>

<A NAME=idx.206>The</A>
features defined in this section can potentially cause unchecked
runtime errors and are thus forbidden in safe interfaces and modules.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.207>An</A>
unchecked type transfer operation has the form: 
<PRE>
    LOOPHOLE(e, T)
</PRE>
where <TT>e</TT> is an expression whose type is not an open array type
and <TT>T</TT> is a type.  It denotes <TT>e</TT>'s bit pattern
interpreted as a variable or value of type <TT>T</TT>.  It is a designator
if <TT>e</TT> is, and is writable if <TT>e</TT> is.
An unchecked runtime error can occur if <TT>e</TT>'s bit pattern
is not a legal <TT>T</TT>, or if <TT>e</TT>
is a designator and some legal bit pattern for <TT>T</TT> is not legal
for <TT>e</TT>.
<P>

If <TT>T</TT> is not an open array type, <TT>BITSIZE(e)</TT> must equal
<TT>BITSIZE(T)</TT>.  If <TT>T</TT> is an open array type, its element type
must not be an open array type, and <TT>e</TT>'s bit pattern is interpreted
as an array whose length is <TT>BITSIZE(e)</TT> divided by
<TT>BITSIZE(</TT>the element type of <TT>T)</TT>.
The division must come out even.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.208>The</A>
following operations are primarily used for address arithmetic:
<PRE>
               ADR  (VAR x: Any)            : ADDRESS 

     infix     +    (x: ADDRESS, y:INTEGER) : ADDRESS
     infix     -    (x: ADDRESS, y:INTEGER) : ADDRESS
     infix     -    (x,y: ADDRESS)          : INTEGER
</PRE>
<TT>ADR(x)</TT> is the address of the variable <TT>x</TT>.  The actual 
argument must be a designator but need not be writable.
The operations
<TT>+</TT> and <TT>-</TT> treat addresses as integers.  The validity of the
addresses produced by these operations is implementation-dependent.
For example, the address of a variable in a local procedure frame
is probably valid only for the duration of the call.  The address
of the referent of a traced reference is probably valid only as long
as traced references prevent it from being collected (and not even
that long if the implementation uses a compacting collector).
<P>

<A NAME=idx.209>In</A>
unsafe modules the <TT>INC</TT> and <TT>DEC</TT> statements apply to 
addresses as well as ordinals:
<PRE>
               INC  (VAR x: ADDRESS; n: INTEGER := 1)
               DEC  (VAR x: ADDRESS; n: INTEGER := 1)
</PRE>
These are short for <TT>x := x + n</TT> and <TT>x := x - n</TT>, except that
<TT>x</TT> is evaluated only once.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.210>A</A>
<TT>DISPOSE</TT> statement has the form:
<PRE>
               DISPOSE (v)
</PRE>
where <TT>v</TT> is a writable designator whose type is not <TT>REFANY</TT>,
<TT>ADDRESS</TT>, or <TT>NULL</TT>.  If <TT>v</TT> is untraced, the statement
frees the storage for <TT>v</TT>'s referent and sets <TT>v</TT> to
<TT>NIL</TT>.
Freeing storage to which active references remain is an unchecked
runtime error.  If <TT>v</TT> is traced, the statement is equivalent to
<TT>v := NIL</TT>.  If <TT>v</TT> is <TT>NIL</TT>, the statement is a no-op.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.211>In</A>
unsafe interfaces and modules the definition of "assignable" for
types is extended:
two reference types <TT>T</TT> and <TT>U</TT> are assignable
if <TT>T <: U</TT> or <TT>U <: T</TT>.
The only effect of this change is to allow a value of
type <TT>ADDRESS</TT> to be assigned to a variable of type
<TT>UNTRACED REF T</TT>.  It is an unchecked runtime error if the value does
not address a variable of type <TT>T</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.212>In</A>
unsafe interfaces and modules the type constructor <TT>UNTRACED REF T</TT>
is allowed for traced as well as untraced <TT>T</TT>, and the fields of
untraced objects can be traced.  If <TT>u</TT> is an untraced reference
to a traced variable <TT>t</TT>, then the validity of the traced references
in <TT>t</TT> is implementation-dependent, since the garbage collector
probably will not trace them through <TT>u</TT>.
