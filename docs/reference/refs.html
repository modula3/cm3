<H2>Reference types</H2>
<P>

A <EM>reference</EM> value is either <TT>NIL</TT> or the address of
a variable, called the referent.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.49>A</A>
reference type is either <EM>traced</EM> or <EM>untraced</EM>.  When 
all traced references to a piece of allocated storage are gone, the 
implementation reclaims the storage. Two reference types are of the 
same <EM>reference class</EM> if they are both traced or both untraced.
A general type is traced if it is a traced reference type, 
a record type any of whose field types is traced, an array type whose 
element type is traced, or a packed type whose underlying unpacked 
type is traced.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.50>A</A>
declaration for a traced reference type has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = REF Type
</PRE>
where <TT>Type</TT> is any type.  The values of <TT>T</TT> are traced 
references to variables of type <TT>Type</TT>, which is called 
the <EM>referent type</EM> of <TT>T</TT>.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.51>A</A>
declaration for an untraced reference type has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = UNTRACED REF Type
</PRE>
where <TT>Type</TT> is any untraced type.
(This restriction is lifted in <A HREF="unsafe.html">unsafe modules</A>.)
The values of <TT>T</TT> are the untraced references 
to variables of type <TT>Type</TT>.    
<P>

<A NAME=idx.52>In</A>
both the traced and untraced cases, the keyword <TT>REF</TT> can 
optionally be preceded by "<TT>BRANDED b</TT>" where <TT>b</TT> is 
a text constant called the <EM>brand</EM>.  Brands distinguish types 
that would otherwise be the same; they have no other semantic effect. 
All brands in a program must be distinct. If <TT>BRANDED</TT> is present 
and <TT>b</TT> is absent, the implementation automatically supplies 
a unique value for <TT>b</TT>.  Explicit brands are useful for persistent
data storage.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.53>The</A>
following reference types are predeclared:
<PRE>
    REFANY    Contains all traced references
    ADDRESS   Contains all untraced references
    NULL      Contains only <TT>NIL</TT>
</PRE>
The <A HREF="typecase.html"><TT>TYPECASE</TT></A> statement
can be used to test the referent type 
of a <TT>REFANY</TT> or object, but there is 
no such test for an <TT>ADDRESS</TT>.
<P>

Examples of reference types:
<PRE>
    TYPE TextLine = REF ARRAY OF CHAR;

    ControllerHandle = UNTRACED REF RECORD
      status: BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
      filler: BITS 12 FOR [0..0];
      pc: BITS 12 FOR [0..4095]
    END;

    T = BRANDED "ANSI-M3-040776" REF INTEGER;

    Apple  = BRANDED REF INTEGER;
    Orange = BRANDED REF INTEGER;
</PRE>
