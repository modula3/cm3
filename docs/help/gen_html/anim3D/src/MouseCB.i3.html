<P>
<P> In accordance with the terminology used by Trestle, we refer to mouse
   button transitions as to {\em mouse events}. A mouse event is represented
   by a record <CODE>MouseCB.Rec</CODE>.
<P>
   A {\em mouse event callback object} is an object which has one
   method, <CODE>invoke</CODE>. Each geometric object has a stack of mouse callback
   objects. When a mouse event <CODE>mr</CODE> is relayed to a particular geometric
   <CODE>o</CODE>, the the message <CODE>cb.invoke(mr)</CODE> is sent to the top callback
   object on <CODE>o</CODE>'s mouse callback stack (if <CODE>o</CODE>'s mouse callback stack is
   empty, the event is simply dropped). It is <CODE>cb</CODE>'s reponsibility to
   perform whatever action is appropriate in the current context.

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> <CODE>MouseCB.T</CODE> is the abstract class of mouse callback objects. If <CODE>o</CODE> is a
   geometric object, <CODE>c</CODE> is the top object in its mouse callback stack, and
   a mouse event <CODE>mr</CODE> gets relayed to <CODE>o</CODE>, then <CODE>cb.invoke(mr)</CODE> will be called.

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> <CODE>MouseCB.Rec</CODE> is a record type containing information about a mouse event.
   <CODE>pos2D</CODE> is the position of the mouse when the button transition occurred.
   <CODE>whatChanged</CODE> is the button that went up or down.
   <CODE>modifiers</CODE> is the set of modifiers (Shift, Control, Mouse Buttons, etc.)
   that was active when the transition took place.
   <CODE>clickType</CODE> indicates whether the button went down or up, and whether
   any other button was already or still down.
<P>
   {\em NOTE: There is a fair chance that I will add other fields to <CODE>Rec</CODE>,
   once we have gained more experience with event handling. So far, I pretty
   much mimick (part of) what is there in <CODE>VBT.MouseRec</CODE>.} </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
