<P>
<P> In accordance with the terminology used by Trestle, we refer to key
   transitions as to {\em key events}. A key event is represented
   by a record <CODE>KeyCB.Rec</CODE>.
<P>
   A {\em key event callback object} is an object which has one
   method, <CODE>invoke</CODE>. Each geometric object has a stack of key callback
   objects. When a key event <CODE>kr</CODE> is relayed to a particular geometric
   <CODE>o</CODE>, the the message <CODE>cb.invoke(kr)</CODE> is sent to the top callback
   object on <CODE>o</CODE>'s key callback stack (if <CODE>o</CODE>'s key callback stack is
   empty, the event is simply dropped). It is <CODE>cb</CODE>'s reponsibility to
   perform whatever action is appropriate in the current context.

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> <CODE>KeyCB.T</CODE> is the abstract class of key callback objects. If <CODE>o</CODE> is a
   geometric object, <CODE>c</CODE> is the top object in its key callback stack, and
   a key event <CODE>kr</CODE> gets relayed to <CODE>o</CODE>, then <CODE>cb.invoke(kr)</CODE> will be called.
   It is up to the user to create subclasses of <CODE>KeyCB.T</CODE> that handle
   key events in a given context appropriately. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> <CODE>KeyCB.Rec</CODE> is a record type containing information about a key event.
   <CODE>whatChanged</CODE> is the key that went up or down, <CODE>wentDown</CODE> indicates
   whether it went down or up.
   <CODE>modifiers</CODE> is the set of modifiers (Shift, Control, Mouse Buttons, etc.)
   that was active when the transition took place.
<P>
   {\em NOTE: There is a fair chance that I will add other fields to <CODE>Rec</CODE>,
   once we have gained more experience with event handling. So far, I pretty
   much mimick (part of) what is there in <CODE>VBT.KeyRec</CODE>.} </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
