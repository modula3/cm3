 A {\it network object} is an object whose methods can be invoked by
   other programs, in addition to the program that allocated the object.
   The program invoking the method is called the {\it client} and the
   program containing the network object is called the {\it owner}.  The
   client and owner can be running on different machines or in different
   address spaces on the same machine.
   \index{network object}\index{network object!client}
   \index{network object!owner} 

<P> This is the primary public interface for using network objects.
   Before listing the interface, here are a few definitions.
<P>
   A {\it program instance} is an activation of a program.
   The same program can have many instances running concurrently
   or consecutively.  A program instance can be thought of 
   as an address space, although the design does not 
   preclude the implementation of a program instance by a
   suite of address spaces.\index{program instance}
<P>
   An {\it agent}\index{agent} is a program that provides a table that
   maps names to network objects.  Any program can be an agent, but every
   machine has a particular default agent.  Owners typically make 
   network objects available to clients by inserting them 
   into an agent's table, using the procedure <CODE>NetObj.Export</CODE>.  
   Clients typically use <CODE>NetObj.Import</CODE> to retrieve network objects 
   from the table.

   The exception <CODE>NetObj.Error</CODE> indicates possible failures in a remote 
   method invocation.  Every remote method should therefore include
   <CODE>NetObj.Error</CODE> in its raises clause.  If <CODE>NetObj.Error</CODE> is not raised,
   then the invocation completed successfully.  If it is raised, it may
   or may not have completed successfully.  It is possible that an
   {\it orphaned} remote invocation continued to execute at the owner,
   while the client raised <CODE>NetObj.Error</CODE>.\index{orphan computation}
<P>
   The first atom in the argument to <CODE>NetObj.Error</CODE> explains the
   reason for the failure.  The subsequent atoms may provide additional
   implementation-dependent details about the failure.  Here are the
   interpretations of the first atom:
<P>
   The atom <CODE>CommFailure</CODE> indicates communication failure, which might be 
   network failure or a crash on a remote machine.  <CODE>MissingObject</CODE> 
   indicates that some network object, either the one whose method 
   is invoked or an argument to that method, has been garbage-collected 
   by its owner.  (This indicates that the owner mistakenly determined 
   that one of its clients was dead.)  <CODE>NoResources</CODE> indicates that 
   the call failed because of a lack of resources, for example Unix 
   file descriptors.  <CODE>NoTransport</CODE> indicates that an attempt to 
   unmarshal an object failed because the client and owner shared no
   common transport protocol implementation and were therefore unable
   to communicate.  <CODE>UnsupportedDataRep</CODE> indicates a mismatch 
   between the network representation of data and the ability of a 
   receiver to handle it, for example a 64-bit <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> with non-zero 
   high-order bits is not meaningful as an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> on a 32-bit 
   machine. <CODE>Alerted</CODE> indicates that a client thread was alerted in 
   the middle of a remote call and that an orphaned remote 
   computation might still be in progress.  (Threads alerted in remote 
   calls might also raise <CODE>Thread.Alerted</CODE>; in which case 
   it is guaranteed that no orphans remain.)  Any other atoms indicate 
   errors inside the network object runtime.
