PROCEDURE <A HREF="MTextDs.m3.html#InsertBefore">InsertBefore</A> (node, newnode: Node);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> InsertBefore is called ONLY when InsertAfter will not work because there
   is nothing to insert the node before. It proceeds up a leftmost branch
   until it finds a node that is not leftmost; then it calls InsertAfter to
   do the rest of the job. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="MTextDs.m3.html#InsertAfter">InsertAfter</A> (node, newnode: Node);

PROCEDURE <A HREF="MTextDs.m3.html#RemoveNode">RemoveNode</A> (node: Node);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Removes a node (at any height) from the tree, keeping the tree balanced.
   Does not fix heads. Node must not be an ancestor of the anchor node,
   because the anchor node is never removed. The careful observer will note
   that each Remake under here abandons one interior node which is never
   cleaned out. That is all right, because all deleted leaves ARE cleaned
   out, and the abandoned node involves no cycles. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="MTextDs.m3.html#ReplaceLeaf">ReplaceLeaf</A> (old, new: Node);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Sometimes a leaf node must be replaced with an equivalent node of a
   different type. For example, a reader will not read a file node; it must
   be converted into a text node first. ReplaceLeaf assumes that old and
   new are both leaves and have the same length and the same content. It
   will link new into the place formerly occupied by old, and it will
   release any resources implicitly held by old. Heads which pointed into
   old will be fixed. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

 Buf node operations

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="MTextDs.m3.html#BufOpen">BufOpen</A> (node: Node; point, size: CARDINAL);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Internal procedure to insert space in a buf node. We assume that caller
   will then put something reasonable into that space. Node must be a buf
   node, and node.length + size &lt;= m.bufMax. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="MTextDs.m3.html#Free">Free</A> (node: Node);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Free takes a subtree which is no longer needed and shreds it, setting
   all REFs to NIL. This makes it easy for the reference-counting garbage
   collector to clean up after us. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
