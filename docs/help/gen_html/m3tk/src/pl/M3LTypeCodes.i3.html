</PRE> This procedure visits all the units in <CODE>c</CODE> and computes
   the <CODE>tmp_type_code</CODE> attribute (see M3AST_TM) for a subset of 
   the <CODE>TYPE_SPEC</CODE> nodes found in those units. If <CODE>allTypes = TRUE</CODE>, 
   then every <CODE>TYPE_SPEC</CODE> node is included, otherwise only those
   types on the <CODE>UNIT_NORMAL.sm_type_spec_s</CODE> sequence, and
   those types reachable from these are included. This
   restricted set corresponds to the set of reference types,
   for which a Modula-3 runtime environment must have
   type codes.
<P>
   The result of the procedure is a record containing one, two or three
   arrays, all off the same length. The <CODE>types</CODE> array contains
   all the (distinct) types for which a value of <CODE>tmp_type_code</CODE> was 
   computed. Every member of the <CODE>types</CODE> array represents a different 
   type in the sense defined by the Modula-3 structural equivalance
   rules. The value of the <CODE>tmp_type_code</CODE> attribute is an index
   in the range <CODE>0 .. NUMBER(T.types^)-1</CODE>
<P>
   The <CODE>texts</CODE> array is only generated if <CODE>genTexts = TRUE</CODE>.
   The <CODE>fingerprints</CODE> array is only generated if <CODE>genFingerPrints = TRUE</CODE>.
   A member of the <CODE>texts</CODE> array, <CODE>texts[i], is a canonical textual 
   representation for the </CODE>TYPE_SPEC<CODE> in </CODE>types[i]<CODE>. It will
   be distinct for each value of </CODE>i<CODE>. The interface </CODE>M3LTypeToText<CODE>
   documents the format of the generated text. A member of the </CODE>fingerprints<CODE>
   array, </CODE>fingerprints[i]<CODE>, is a unique fingerprint generated from
   the text </CODE>texts[i]<CODE>.
