Computation depends on the following attributes being set:
sm_def                  for used identifiers
sm_concrete_type_spec   for opaque types
sm_type_spec            for named types
sm_exp_type_spec        for the 'as_callexp' field of procedure calls and on
                        expressions which are, in fact, named types (e.g. in
                        FIRST(Enum), 'Enum' looks like an expression but is
                        really a named type).
