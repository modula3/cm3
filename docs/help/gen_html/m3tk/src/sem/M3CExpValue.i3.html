previous computation of 'sm_def', 'sm_type_spec' (1), 'sm_exp_type_spec' and

Also provides utility procedure which evaluate ordinal expressions, as
integers.

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Create a new closure for use with the tree walker and the 'Set' procedure
below. The two arguments are used to determine whether it is necessary to check
that any expressions found in the tree walk are constant.
 'interface' is needed because var declarations in interfaces must have
constant defaults.
 The 'node' argument is necessary if the tree walk is to be started inside:
1) a TYPE_SPEC (all expressions in types are constant)
2) a Const_decl
3) the label list of a Case node
4) a Var_decl node in an interface
If so 'node' should be set to the TYPE_SPEC, Const_decl, Case or Var_decl node
in question. The walk should never be started inside an expression as there
are some special cases which cannot be handled without knowing the whole
expression (e.g. arguments to LAST etc. can be variable even in a constant
expression). </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Sets the 'sm_exp_value' attribute for all constant expressions. Should only
be used with a treewalker visiting 'OnEntryAndExit'. Also checks that any
expressions which must be constant really are  </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

returns an INTEGER to aid the compiler in implementing the subtype
rule for arrays. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> If 'e' is an ordinal expression of known value, converts its value into an
integer and returns 'Valid'. If overflow occurs 'i' is not updated and
'Overflow' is returned. If 'e' is not an ordinal expression or has unknown
value 'i' is not updated and 'Unknown' is returned </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

    VAR (*out*) low, high: M3AST_SM.Exp_value): M3CBackEnd.NumStatus RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Return the bounds of an ordinal or packed ordinal type. A return of
'Unknown' means one of many things was incorrect (e.g. type NIL or not ordinal,
error evaluating subrange bounds etc.) and it leaves 'low' and 'high'
unchanged. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="M3CExpValue.m3.html#Equal">Equal</A>(e1, e2: M3AST_AS.EXP): BOOLEAN RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> If 'e1' and 'e2' are constant expressions and appear to be equal returns
TRUE, otherwise returns FALSE. Is sometimes optimistic; for a thorough check
a call of equal must be guarded by a check that the types of 'e1' and 'e2'
are compatible.
  'Equal' handles all kinds of expressions, including constructors </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
