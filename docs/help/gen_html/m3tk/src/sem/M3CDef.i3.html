</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Set the (simple) 'sm_def' attribute in 'an'.  This depends on no other
attributes having been computed, but requires an OnEntryAndExit tree walk.
Only the leftmost id in a select operation is resolved - those to the right
depend on the type of this id, which is not known until 'sm_type_spec'
is known (which in turn depends on simple 'sm_def's being set). Note that
qualids which are not in expressions are fully resolved by 'SetPass1'; they,
unlike qualids in expressions, cannot be confused with select operations.
'SetPass1' calls 'IgnoreChildren' and hence is not suitable for a <CODE>parallel</CODE>
walk with another procedure.

Interface_AS_id). </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> 'keyword' is the keyword in a keyword procedure argument or constructor
element. 'ResolveActualKeyword' is called to bind it to its definition. This
is done by callback because the effort involved in resolving keyword arguments
is quite large, especially for NEW, so it is worth trying to avoid duplicating
it </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
