<P> This module provides specialised forms of name resolution not handled by
'M3CScope'. 'M3CScope' handles the problems of lexical scope for the main
block structure of the program. 'M3CSearch' provides, for example, searching
to see if a given name is a field of a given record type.
  The procedures in this module take two arguments. The first argument provides
the context for the search. The second argument is a 'Used_id', which is the
item to be looked up in the context. If the search succeeds the 'Used_id' is
updated so that it points to its defining occurence. If the search fails the
'Used_id' is left unchanged and an error message may be given.
  An error message need not always be given if the search fails because the
implementation may keep track of previous failed searches in the same context.
In this case the implementation could avoid giving repeated error messages for
identical failed searches. Note that the implementation does not guarantee to
do this but it does mean that the user of the interface should not rely on
getting an error message for every failed lookup
