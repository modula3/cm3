END ASTWalk.
</PRE> The <CODE>ASTWalk</CODE> interface provides a way to visit every node in an
AST, applying a user-supplied method at each node.  This process is
often referred to a {\em tree walk} or an {\em AST walk}.
<P>
The children of a node of some type <CODE>T</CODE> are visited in the order
defined by the implementation of the <CODE>walk</CODE> method for <CODE>T</CODE>. Typically
this is defined to be the {\em natural} order, that is, corresponding
to reading the program text.
<P>
The caller can choose whether the callback method is applied on entry
to the node, on exit from the node, or both.  A walk may be aborted at
any time.  All the state associated with a walk is captured in the
<CODE>Closure</CODE> argument. So walks may be nested or performed in parallel,
using different closure arguments. The caller should subtype the
<CODE>Closure</CODE> type in order to support argument passing or the return of
results from the callback method. The closure should be created
by a call of the form <CODE>NEW(Closure, callback := YourCallback).init()</CODE>.
<P>
The callback may raise any exception, including <CODE>Aborted</CODE>. The latter
is caught by <CODE>VisitNodes</CODE> and <CODE>ModeVisitNodes</CODE>, and aborts the
walk, returning control to the caller. Any other exception
also aborts the walk and is propagated to the caller.
<P>
The <CODE>VisitNodes</CODE> procedure supports the most common type of walk,
which is to vis to apply the callback method on {\em entry} to the
node, that is before the children are visited (pre-order).
<P>
<CODE>ModeVisitNodes</CODE> takes a <CODE>VisitModeControl</CODE> argument that allows
the callback method to be applied on entry, exit or both. The
<CODE>OnExit</CODE> value can be used to perform a post-order walk, that is,
applying the method after all the children have been visited.
<P>
It is sometimes convenient to suppress the visit of the children of a
given node, and this can be achieved by calling <CODE>IgnoreChildren</CODE> from
the callback method. Once control leaves the node from which the call
was made, the suppression is disabled. A typical use is to mix
pre-order and post-order walks by, say, starting a pre-order walk,
calling <CODE>IgnoreChildren</CODE> at some node and from the callback begin a
post-order walk of the children.  
<P>
The <CODE>NodeProcClosure</CODE> provides a simple way to create a closure
value for a callback method that neither requires any state nor
cares about the <CODE>VisitMode</CODE> argument.
