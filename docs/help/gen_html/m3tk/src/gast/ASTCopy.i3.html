<P> <CODE>ASTCopy</CODE> provides a way to copy all or part of an AST.

    n: AST.NODE;
    c: Closure;
    vm : ASTWalk.VisitModeControl;

END ASTCopy.
</PRE> The <CODE>ASTCopy</CODE> interface allows an AST to be copied, with provision
for the caller to be called back at each node, using a similar
mechanism to the <CODE>ASTWalk</CODE> interface. The callback can be used to copy
or share additional attributes that are not copied by the underlying
<CODE>copy</CODE> method, for example attributes that cause the AST to form a
graph rather than a tree. 
<P>
The <CODE>Nodes</CODE> procedure provides for a simple copy of the tree rooted at
its argument, <CODE>n</CODE>, without any callbacks.
<P>
The <CODE>ModeNodes</CODE> takes a closure argument that should be created with a
call of <CODE>NEW(Closure, callback := YourCallback).init()</CODE>. The closure can be
subtyped to provide for shared state to be accessed during the
callbacks. The <CODE>vm</CODE> argument can be used to control when the callback
are made in the way described in the <CODE>ASTWalk</CODE> interface. On an
{\em entry} callback to a node, the value of the <CODE>ncopy</CODE> will be <CODE>NIL</CODE>.
On an {\em exit} callback, <CODE>ncopy</CODE> will refer to the newly created copy.
<P>
The <CODE>IgnoreChildren</CODE> procedure can be called to suppress the copying
of a node's children. Once control leaves the node from which the call
was made, the suppression is disabled. It is only effective when
called in {\em entry} mode.
