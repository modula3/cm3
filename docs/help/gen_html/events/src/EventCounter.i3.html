 * 
 * HISTORY
 * Idea taking from a C version of similar idea in MUTS, written by
 *     Robbert van Renesse, Brad Glade, Cornell University 
 *
 * This module implements event counters.
 * Event counters are like MUTEXs, but can only be grabbed in a certain
 * order.  Furthermore, other threads are allowed to wait for a certain
 * event values to be reached without incrementing the counter.  
 * Finally, instead of blocking, a thread can leave an event
 * associated with an event value on the internal queue, which can be
 * processed .
 *
 * The lock associated with an EventCount is a RdWrMutex, and is
 * passed in via the <CODE>init()</CODE> method. 
 *
 * The intended use for event counters is to syncronize threads that are
 * handling numbered events that may arrive out of order.
 * The wait() method allows additional threads to wait until after a
 * certain numbered event has finished.  These <CODE>wait()</CODE>ing threads
 * will run after the event value has been reached and 
 * do not lock the counter.  This implies two things:
 *   - the scheduler may end up running these threads at some arbitrary
 *     time, so a thread that waits for the event counter to reach value N
 *     should not depend on it being N when it is run.
 *   - these threads should not call release(), since they haven't
 *     acquired()d the lock.
 *
 * The <CODE>init()</CODE> method should be called to initialize a new event
 * counter.  By default, the counter is initialized to zero. 
 * The <CODE>acquire(value: EventNumber.T)</CODE> method is like Thread.Acquire(), but
 * blocks until the mutex is free and the event counter reaches the
 * given value.  If multiple attempts are made to acquire the same
 * value, all but one will raise the <CODE>Duplicate</CODE> exception when the counter
 * reaches the given value (duplicates will not be checked until that
 * point).  It is undefined which one will acquire the lock, and which
 * will receive an exception.  <CODE>tryAcquire()</CODE> is similar to acquire,
 * but will not block.  If the lock cannot be acquired immediately, it
 * will return FALSE.  Otherwise the lock is acquired and
 * <CODE>tryAcquire()</CODE> returns TRUE.
 *
 * <CODE>enqueueAction(value: EventNumber.T; handler: Handler)</CODE> adds an
 * action to the EventCount queue that will be exectuted with the
 * counter reaches <CODE>value.</CODE>  An enqueued action is semantically
 * similar to a thread acquiring the lock, executing the
 * action itself when the acquire succeeds, and then releasing the
 * lock.  However, the action will be executed by the thread that
 * releases the lock when it is at <CODE>value-1.</CODE>  If the enqueued action
 * can be executed (no other thread or action has acquired the lock at
 * the requested value), <CODE>handler.handle()</CODE> will be called to execute
 * the action.  If the action cannot be executed because a duplicate
 * value has already been acquired, <CODE>handler.duplicate()</CODE> will be called.
 *
 * The <CODE>release()</CODE> method is similar to Thread.Release(), but 
 * increments the event counter in addition to releasing the lock.
 * The <CODE>wait(value: Integer.T)</CODE> method causes the threads to
 * wait until the event counter is <CODE>release()</CODE>d by the thread that
 * acquire()d it with the same value, incrementing the counter past the
 * value. 
 *
 * If the event number overflows its maximum value, <CODE>release()</CODE> raises
 * <CODE>Overflow</CODE>.
 *
 * The <CODE>set(value: EventNumber.T)</CODE> is similar to acquire except that
 * it sets the value of the counter to value.  However, set can never
 * lower the value of the counter, and an <CODE>Invalid</CODE> exception will be
 * raised if this is attempted.  A call to <CODE>set()</CODE> will lock the
 * counter and then change it.  If a set of clients are already
 * waiting to <CODE>acquire()</CODE> the next <CODE>N</CODE> values of the counter, some <CODE>M</CODE>
 * of them, <CODE>M &lt;= N</CODE>, may acquire the counter before <CODE>set()</CODE>.  Once
 * <CODE>set()</CODE> acquires the counter, it is set to the new value and all
 * clients that were blocked attempting to acquire some value less
 * than this new value are unblocked with a <CODE>Duplicate</CODE> exception. All
 * clients that were blocked waiting for some value less than this new
 * value are unblocked.
