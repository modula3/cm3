<H2>Network object support</H2>
<P>

The following procedures are used to build programs using
network objects.
<P>

<B> netobj(X,T) </B>
      runs the network objects stub generator on the interface <TT>X.i3</TT>
      to produce the network object glue needed to manipulate objects
      of type <TT>X.T</TT>.  The resulting source files are included
      in the current build.
<P>

<B> Netobj(X,T) </B>
      Like <TT>netobj</TT>, but also exports the resulting interface.
