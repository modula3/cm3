<h2>m3makefiles</h2>

<p><tt>m3makefile</tt>s are in fact <tt><a href="../quake.html">quake</a></tt>
programs. <tt><a href="../quake.html">quake</a></tt> is an interpreter
for a small, but powerful programming language. It's an imperative language
with variables, arrays, tables, conditionals, loops, and procedures. The
full features of that language are available if required, but very few
<tt>m3makefile</tt>s need this extra generality. </p>

<p>Described with the <a href="m3build.html">builder</a> are the facilities
(many of them programmed in <tt><a href="../quake.html">quake</a></tt>)
that <tt>cm3</tt> users should need. Most <tt>m3makefile</tt>s are
simply sequences of calls to these predefined procedures. </p>
