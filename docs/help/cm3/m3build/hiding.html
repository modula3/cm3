<H2>Hiding and exporting</H2>
<P>

The following procedures can be used in two ways.  First to provide a
clearer indication of visibility than is given by the capitalization
convention (which exists partly to support old style <TT>m3makefile</TT>s).
Second, to change the visibility of imported components.
Generally, it's much better to convince the owners of the exporting
package to give their sources the correct visibility rather than
overriding their initial decision.
<P>

<B> hide_interface(X) </B>  
          sets the visibility of interface <TT>X.i3</TT> to hidden.
 
<P>

<B> export_interface(X) </B>  
          sets the visibility of interface <TT>X.i3</TT> to visible.
 
<P>

<P>

There are also variants that hide or export programs and generics,
<TT>hide_program</TT>,
<TT>hide_generic_interface</TT>,
<TT>hide_generic_implementation</TT>,
<TT>export_program</TT>,
<TT>export_generic_interface</TT>,
and
<TT>export_generic_implementation</TT>.
<P>

Hidden program are not copied to the <TT>/bin</TT>
directory, exported ones are.
