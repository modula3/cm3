The language interpreted by formsview (i.e., by the Modula-3 FormsVBT
runtime interface) is defined in the FormsVBT Reference Manual.  Some
of the properties can be changed at runtime.
    
The following universal properties are supported:

        BgColor
        Color
        DarkShadow
        Font
        Labelfont
        LightShadow
        Name
        ShadowSize

A Macro definition can appear anywhere, as if it were a universal
property. The syntax for defining a macro is:
    
        (Macro <name> [BOA] <formals> <expression>)

            Example:

                (Macro Boxed (x)
                  `(Border (Pen 2) (Rim (Pen 16) ,x)))

            The syntax for calling a macro is

                (<name> (<formal> <actual>) (<formal> <actual>) ...)

            Example:

                (Boxed (x (Text (BgColor "Red") "Warning")))

            That expands into

                (Border (Pen 2)
                    (Rim (Pen 16)
                        (Text (BgColor "Red") "Warning"))))

            If the keyword BOA ("by order of arguments") appears
            in the macro definition, then the arguments are
            positional and not named. Example:

                (Macro Ht BOA (n v) `(Shape (Height ,n) ,v))

            Given that definition,
		(Ht 20 (Button "Go!"))
	    expands into
	        (Shape (Height 20) (Button "Go!"))
            
            Macros must be defined before they are called. The effect
            of using a macro to redefine an existing name (e.g., VBox)
            is undefined. The expressions should expand into legal
            forms, including Macros.  Nested backquotes are permitted.
            Within a backquote, you may use "," to insert a value,
            or ",@" to append a list of values.  Example:

                (Macro V (items) `(VBox (Color "Red") ,@items))
                (V (items ("abc" "def")))

            The second form expands into

                (VBox (Color "Red") "abc" "def")

Font and LabelFont take string-arguments, e.g., 

    "fixed"
    "-*-new century schoolbook-*-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*"
    
They also take their own property lists for the individual
metrics:

	Foundry
	Family
	WeightName
	Slant
	Width
	PointSize
	HRes
	VRes
	Spacing
	AvgWidth
	Encoding
	Registry

PointSize is a cardinal, and it actually represents TENTHS of a point,
so a 12-point would be specified as (PointSize 120).  All the other
metrics are text.  The defaults are:

(Font	(Foundry	"*")
	(Family		"fixed")
	(WeightName	"medium")
	(Slant		"r")
	(Width		"semicondensed")
	(PointSize 	100)
	(HRes 		"*")
	(VRes 		"*")
	(Spacing	"*")
	(AvgWidth 	"*")
	(Encoding 	"iso8859")
	(Registry 	"1"))
(LabelFont
	(Foundry	"*")
	(Family		"helvetica")
	(WeightName	"bold")
	(Slant		"r")
	(Width		"*")
	(PointSize 	100)
	(HRes 		"*")
	(VRes 		"*")
	(Spacing	"*")
	(AvgWidth 	"*")
	(Encoding 	"iso8859")
	(Registry 	"1"))
	
Most users will specify only Family, WeightName,
and PointSize.  Examples:

    (Font (Family "courier") (WeightName "Bold"))
    (LabelFont (Family "Times") (PointSize 240))
