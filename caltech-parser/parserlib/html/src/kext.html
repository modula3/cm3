PL_BEGIN(kext: extending tokens&#044; lexers&#044; and parsers)

Using _BF(kext),
generated _TI<!-- -->s, _LI<!-- -->s, and _YI<!-- -->s are
extended to produce new interfaces with extended _TT(ParseType)s.
Additionally, user code can extend lexer expression
methods and parser reduction methods. Declarations and code can also
be added to the body of the new interface and implementation.
<P>

_A(input)_H(extfile)

An _IT(extfile) is a file having the _TT(.e) suffix, and which begins with
the following two lines

<PRE>
%source MyLang.t [MyLang.l] [MyLang.y]
%import MyLangTok [MyLangLex] [MyLangParse]
</PRE>

where _TT([]) indicates optional arguments.

The _TT(%source) line names the specifications of the interfaces to be
extended, and the _TT(%import) line gives the names of those
interfaces. The output interface is always a _TI, and if a _LI or _YI
was _TT(%import)ed as a second argument, then the output interface
will also be the same kind of interface. This allows tokens to be
extended either alone in a _TI, or if desired in a _LI or _YI.
<P>

As with any lexer or parser, an extended lexer or parser is
_LN(ktok.html#compat, compatible) with another lexer or parser if it
imports the same _TI, even if the _TI is itself a _LI or _YI.
<P>

_H(extending _TT(ParseType)s)

The following line in an extfile:

<PRE>
parseType: {val: INTEGER; t: TEXT}
</PRE>

means _TT(parseType) is extended with the fields _TT(val) and _TT(t)
added to the object type. If _TT(parseType) is not a _TT(Token) then
the fields can have initializations (current implementation restriction). 

_H(extending lexers)

The following lines in an extfile:

<PRE>
exprName {RETURN NEW(STRING, val := 15, t := $)}
exprName {$R STRING{$$ := 15; $$.t := $}}
</PRE>

both mean that the expression method named _TT(exprName) is overridden
to return a new _TT(STRING) token whose _TT(val) field is initialized
to _TT(15), and whose _TT(t) field is initialized
to the _TT(TEXT) of the matched token. The second version might not
call _TT(NEW) if previously allocated tokens of type _TT(STRING) have
been _TT(discard())ed but not _TT(detach())ed (see below).
<P>

As in other _BF(lex)es, the type of the result can depend upon the
matched text, so long as the result is a _TT(Token). This means, for
example, that the returned type need not be the same as in the default method.

_H(extending parsers)

The following line:

<PRE>
ruleName {$$ := $1 + $2}
</PRE>

assumes that the last line of the form _TT(parseType: {...}) refers to
the return type of a rule declared as _TT(ruleName).
The meaning is that the reduction method (named
_TT(ruleName_returnType)) is overridden. _TT("$1") and _TT("$2") refer
respectively to the first and second
_LN(ktok.html#const,nonconstant) symbols appearing in the reduction
method _LN(kyacc.html#reducmeth,declaration). It is assumed that the
types of both of these symbols and the return symbol have a field
named _TT(val), which in this case must be of type _TT(INTEGER). The
line could have
been written equivalently as

<PRE>
ruleName {$$.val := $1.val + $2.val}
</PRE>

To refer to the _TT(ParseType) itself, _TT("$x") is written
_TT("$x.detach()"), and _TT("$$") is written _TT("result"). For
example, consider a rule which reduces its only nonconstant symbol to
its own type (imagine removing balanced parentheses).
The following two lines in an extfile

<PRE>
ruleName {$$ := $1}
ruleName {result := $1.detach()}
</PRE>

do not quite mean the same thing. Even if the only field in _TT(returnType)
is _TT(val), the generated interface may be further extended, so that
in the second version
copying the _TT(ParseType) copies more fields than just
_TT(val). Additionally, if _TT(ruleName) is extended then the extended
method will see _TT(result = $1.detach()).
<P>

Detaching _TT(ParseType)s gives a simple way to construct parse trees
whose nodes are the _TT(ParseType)s themselves. For an example, see 
_LN(calc.html#CPT,_TT(CalcParseTree.e)).
<P>

_H(extra interface and module code)

Sometimes it is necessary to add code to the generated interface and
module, for example to _TT(IMPORT) interfaces defining types
referenced in the extended types and methods. Also it is common to add
_TT(init) methods to parsers, etc. The following is the
form of such code:

<PRE>
%place {
(* your Modula-3 code here *)
}
</PRE>

For a _TI, _TT(%place) can be either _TT(%interface) or _TT(%module).
For a _LI or _YI, _TT(%place) can also be
_TT(%public), _TT(%private), or _TT(%overrides).
The code is inserted into the generated interface as follows:

<PRE>
INTERFACE MyLangThingSpecial;
IMPORT ...;

    %interface

TYPE
  T <: Public
  Public = MyLangThing.T OBJECT

    %public

  END;
...
</PRE>

and code is inserted into the generated implementation as follows:

<PRE>
MODULE MyLangThingSpecial;
IMPORT ...;

    %module

REVEAL
  T = Public BRANDED OBJECT

    %private

    ...
  OVERRIDES

    %overrides

    ...
  END;
...
</PRE>
