# This file tests that integer overflows are caught when reading both signed
# and unsigned integers. This file assumes that both signed and unsigned
# integers are 4-byte words (hence, the "4" in the filename).

# signed integers
i  16_7fffffff 	# => 2147483647
i   2147483647	# => 2147483647
i  16_80000000	# => Integer Overflow
i   2147483648	# => Integer Overflow
i  21474836400	# => Integer Overflow
i -16_80000000	# => -2147483648
i  -2147483648	# => -2147483648
i -16_80000001	# => Integer Overflow
i  -2147483649	# => Integer Overflow
i -21474836400	# => Integer Overflow

# unsigned integers
u  ffffffff	# => ffffffff
u 100000000	# => Integer Overflow

# The following examples produce integer overflows, but should read all the
# base-10 and -16 digits, respectively. Hence, the 'i' input should stop
# reading at the last '9', and the 'u' input should stop reading at the 'F'.
i 999999999999999999999ABCDEFGHIJ	# => Integer Overflow, "ABCDEFGHIJ"
u 999999999999999999999ABCDEFGHIJ	# => Integer Overflow, "GHIJ"
