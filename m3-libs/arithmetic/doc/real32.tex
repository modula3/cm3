\section{Real: 32-bit IEEE Reals}

The basic library architecture is based on 64-bit reals.  But it
is sometimes handy to use 32-bit reals.  And if you are going to use
them, it helps to have the standard constants and functions
available.  We have provided wrappers for the normal Math.i3 functions,
in order to hide the type conversions to and from 64-bit reals.

However, that means the 32-bit versions of the functions
are {\em slower} than the 64-bit versions.  Eventually, perhaps
we should have direct calls to a library of 32-bit real assembler
code.  For now, Real32.i3/m3 is just a convenience.
