(* "RTHeapRep" is a private, implementation-dependent extension to
   "RTAllocator", "RTCollector", and "RTHeap". *)

UNSAFE INTERFACE RTHeapRep;

(* This interface provides low-level access to the storage allocator and
   garbage collector.  Some items here should be made private or moved
   elsewhere. *)

IMPORT RT0, Word;
FROM RT0 IMPORT Typecode;

(* The allocator and collector maintain two heaps of objects.  One heap is
   "traced" (its objects are collected); the other is "untraced".

   The allocator for the untraced heap is simply "malloc".  Unless
   explicitly noted, all procedures and variables here are for the traced
   heap.  Unless explicitly noted, none of the variables in this interface
   are writable. *)

(****** PAGES ******)

(* The (traced) heap consists of a number of aligned pages, divided among
   three spaces: Free, Previous, and Current.  All other pages in the
   address space are in the "Unallocated" space.  Pages are numbered 0, 1,
   2, ....  The pagesize used is fixed and must be a power of two.

   The global variable p0 and p1 hold the bounds of the heap pages: only
   pages in the range [p0, p1) are in a space other than Unallocated.  For
   these pages, the array "desc" holds more information; desc[p - p0] holds
   state for page "p".

   The heap page size used to be machine-dependent, since it could depend
   on the architecture's VM page size (if VM was TRUE). VM is now always
   FALSE. Otherwise, 64K bytes is a reasonable page size. The page size must
   be a power of two. 
   
   Actually 64K is chosen because it is the granularity of VirtualAlloc on
   Windows (GetSystemInfo.dwAllocationGranularity).
   Using smaller than this on Windows, with VirtualAlloc, will allocate
   extra memory but never use it. So it is in fact somewhat machine-dependent.
   Smaller values like 4K or 8K are reasonable on other platforms, however
   larger values do reduce some bookkeeping overhead (but probably
   also have an advantage.) It may also make sense to make this
   a variable and tune it at runtime (or at least startup) to adapt
   to machines with more or less memory (e.g. more memory => larger pages).
   (note that memory can be added/removed to some running systems!
   not to mention overall system memory pressure..)

   than a page; they span multiple contiguous pages.  For large objects,
   pages following the first are marked "continued".  The large object is
   the only object on its pages; it starts at the beginning of its first
   page, and no other objects follow it on its last page.

   Special "filler" objects are used to exactly fill out the end of a page
   of small objects, or to fill space between small objects when they
   cannot exactly follow the previous object because of alignment
   restrictions.  There are 1-word and multi-word filler objects.  The
   beginning of a page is always adequate alignment, so a filler object
   need never begin a page. *)
