     Note that the value of buffer could lie anywhere inside the range tooLow
     to tooHigh.
    
     boundaryLow, boundaryHigh and w are approximations of the real boundaries
     and v (the input number). They are guaranteed to be precise up to one unit.
     In fact the error is guaranteed to be strictly less than one unit.
    
     Anything that lies outside the unsafe interval is guaranteed not to round
     to v when read again.
     Anything that lies inside the safe interval is guaranteed to round to v
     when read again.
     If the number inside the buffer lies inside the unsafe interval but not
     inside the safe interval then we simply do not know and bail out (returning
     false).
    
     Similarly we have to take into account the imprecision of 'w' when finding
     the closest representation of 'w'. If we have two potential
     representations, and one is closer to both wLow and wHigh, then we know
     it is closer to the actual value v.
    
     By generating the digits of tooHigh we got the largest (closest to
     tooHigh) buffer that is still in the unsafe interval. In the case where
     wHigh < buffer < tooHigh we try to decrement the buffer.
     This way the buffer approaches (rounds towards) w.
     There are 3 conditions that stop the decrementation process:
       1) the buffer is already below wHigh
       2) decrementing the buffer would make it leave the unsafe interval
       3) decrementing the buffer would yield a number below wHigh and farther
          away than the current number. In other words:
                  (buffer{-1} < wHigh) AND wHigh - buffer{-1} > buffer - wHigh
     Instead of using the buffer directly we use its distance to tooHigh.
     Conceptually rest ~= tooHigh - buffer
     We need to do the following tests in this order to avoid over- and
     underflows.*)

(* Generates the digits of input number w.

    * low < w < high, and taking into account their error: low~ <= high~
    * MinTargetExponent <= w.e() <= MaxTargetExponent
   Postconditions: returns false if procedure fails.
     otherwise:
       * buffer is not null-terminated, but len contains the number of digits.
       * buffer contains the shortest possible decimal digit-sequence
         such that LOW < buffer * 10^kappa < HIGH, where LOW and HIGH are the
         correct values of low and high (without their error).
       * if more than one decimal representation gives the minimal number of
         decimal digits then the one closest to W (where W is the correct value
         of w) is chosen.
   Remark: this procedure takes into account the imprecision of its input
     numbers. If the precision is not enough to guarantee all the postconditions
     then false is returned. This usually happens rarely (~0.5%).
  
   Say, for the sake of example, that
     w.e() = -48, and w.f() = 0x1234567890abcdef
   w's value can be computed by w.f() * 2^w.e()
   We can obtain w's integral digits by simply shifting w.f() by -w.e().
    -> w's integral part is 0x1234
    w's fractional part is therefore 0x567890abcdef.
   Printing w's integral part is easy (simply print 0x1234 in decimal).
   In order to print its fraction we repeatedly multiply the fraction by 10 and
   get each digit. Example the first digit after the point would be computed by
     (0x567890abcdef * 10) >> 48. -> 3
   The whole thing becomes slightly more complicated because we want to stop
   once we have enough digits. That is, once the digits inside the buffer
   represent 'w' we can stop. Everything inside the interval low - high
   represents w. However we have to pay attention to low, high and w's
   imprecision. *)
