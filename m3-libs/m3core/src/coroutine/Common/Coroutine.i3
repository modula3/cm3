     call the coroutine c at its last activation point and suspend the
     current coroutine at its current activation point

     when Call returns, returns the handle of the coroutine it was
     called from

     if the called coroutine returns normally (using RETURN), the last
     coroutine to call c will be activated at its last activation
     point

     A current implementation restriction is that the target coroutine
     must be in the same thread as the calling coroutine.  This is not
     a technically necessary restriction and may be removed in future
     versions.  (Note to implementer: shifting a coroutine between
     threads would involve moving the stack from one thread's linked
     list of stacks to another thread's list in ThreadPThread.m3)

  (* Example of using this interface:

     VAR
       c := Create(NEW(Closure, apply := Apply));
     BEGIN
       IO.Put("hello");
       Call(c);
       IO.Put("world");
       Call(c);
       IO.Put(Retval(c));
     END;

         IO.Put(", ");
         Call(from);
         IO.Put("!\n");
         RETURN "and goodbye!\n";
       END Apply;

      will print the text

      hello, world!
      and goodbye!

      on the terminal
