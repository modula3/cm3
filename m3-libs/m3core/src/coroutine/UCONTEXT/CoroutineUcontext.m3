(* Modula-3 coroutines
   Author : Mika Nystrom <mika.nystroem@intel.com>
   June, 2018

   Implements coroutines without stack back-references.  Interface is
   thus very similar to Modula-3 Thread.T.

   Some of the code will only work on AMD64 at present.

   There are assumptions that: 
   1. pointers are 64 bits 
   2. stack grows downward
   3. we rely on ThreadPThread.m3
   4. we (further) rely on pthread thread-local (global) storage

   Most of these assumptions are in the C code accompanying.

  (* notes on garbage collection:

     A "T" is a reference held by the client.

     We desire the following behavior.

     If a T is active (i.e., running = head of its thread), it should not be
     collected.

     If a T is referenced by any active or inactive stack, it should not be
     collected.

     An inactive T must not reference itself (unless of course the client
     does so for it, which would inhibit collection).

     Corollaries of the above are that--
     an active T must have a reference to itself on its own stack, to inhibit
     collection.  An inactive T must not have a reference to itself on its own
     stack, so as not to inhibit collection.

     Any reference from an inactive T's stack to itself must go via the
     indirection of the coArr table and use its coroutine id.

     Any reference to an inactive T may go NIL at any time (via GC and WeakRef
     activity.)

     An initial coroutine is a coroutine started outside of this framework,
     i.e., a coroutine with a stack created by the threading system (or the
     C runtime).  Such a coroutine should not be collected.

     A reference from a coroutine to its successor (which inhibits collection
     of the successor) is OK.  If the successor is to be collected, it will
     eventually be collected through several rounds of GC.

  (* the whole GetCurrentCoroutine / SetCurrentCoroutine dance is really 
     only used for one purpose, namely, to ensure that we can see that 
     the initial creator (mother coroutine) has a Coroutine.T whither 
     new coroutines may return.

     I wonder if there is a simpler way.  One approach would be to
     require every thread to have a mother coroutine record created
     when the thread is created.  That could simplify a few things,
     but would require (probably) changes to Thread.T (maybe could be
     isolated to ThreadPThread only...)  It would only really hide the
     thread local (global) issues in the threading library---these
     issues dont seem to go away.
