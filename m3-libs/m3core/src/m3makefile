% These are special objects.
% Mainly they are to avoid importing data on Windows.
% i.e. They are always statically linked.
%
% But hand.obj might also be useful on non-Windows.
% hand.obj contains helper functions for set manipulation,
% referenced by some backends. Dynamic linking it should be ok,
% but the functions have also churned through the years and static
% linking might provide better compatibility. Todo.
%
% Failure to static link Uconstants on Windows is quite fatal,
% due to TRY alloca(m3_jumpbuf_size) and m3_jumpbuf_size is in Uconstants.obj.
% Todo: Attempt various kinds of "passthrough" in C backend.
%
% The values could be output by the backend, or even the generated C
% include the native headers and reference the native symbols.
