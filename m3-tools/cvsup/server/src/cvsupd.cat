     ccvvssuuppdd is the server program for the CCVVSSuupp network distribution package.
     For information about the companion client program, see cvsup(1).

     In normal usage, ccvvssuuppdd should be started with the `--CC _m_a_x_C_l_i_e_n_t_s'
     option.  Unless --ff is specified, it runs as a background daemon, fielding
     connection requests from remote clients.  For each connection, ccvvssuuppdd
     forks a child process to serve the files requested by the client.

     The following options are supported:

     --AA _a_d_d_r     Specifies a local address (dotted quad or hostname) on which
                 the server will accept connections.  This may be useful on
                 hosts which have multiple IP addresses.

     --bb _b_a_s_e     Uses _b_a_s_e as the base directory for the configuration files.
                 The default is _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_e_t_c_/_c_v_s_u_p.

     --cc _c_o_l_l_P_a_t_h
                 Searches the specified directories for information about the
                 collections being offered.  _c_o_l_l_P_a_t_h contains of one or more
                 directory names, separated by colons.  Non-absolute pathnames
                 are interpreted relative to the base directory.  The default
                 search path is `sup'.

     --CC _m_a_x_C_l_i_e_n_t_s
                 Limits the number of simultaneous clients to _m_a_x_C_l_i_e_n_t_s.
                 Clients beyond the specified maximum are politely refused
                 service.

                 If this option is not specified, ccvvssuuppdd serves one client in
                 the foreground and then exits.

     --ee          Suppresses the redirection of the standard output and stan-
                 dard error when running as a daemon and logging to a syslog
                 facility.  Otherwise, these descriptors are redirected to
                 _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.  This option is useful for capturing any panic
                 messages which might be emitted in the rare event of a crash
                 of the server.  Such messages are very helpful for debugging,
                 but there is no reliable way to send them to syslog.  A rec-
                 ommended way to use the option is like this:
                       cvsupd -e ... >>/var/tmp/cvsupd.out 2>&1
                 assuming that the command line syntax of sh(1) is used.

     --ff          When --CC _m_a_x_C_l_i_e_n_t_s is specified, causes ccvvssuuppdd to stay in the
                 foreground instead of becoming a background daemon.

     --ll _l_o_g      Directs log messages to _l_o_g.  If _l_o_g is of the form @@_f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y
                 (e.g., `@local0') then logging is done via syslog to the
                 indicated facility.  Otherwise, _l_o_g is treated as the name of
                 a log file.  If the file already exists, new messages are
                 appended to its end.

                 For each client served, at least two messages are logged.
                 The first message identifies the client by username and host-
                 name.  The last message reports the success or failure of the
                 update and gives the total network I/O in Kbytes (1K = 1024).
                 Additional messages may be emitted to report errors or other
                 noteworthy conditions.

     --pp _p_o_r_t     Listens for connections on an alternate TCP port.  The
                 default port is 5999.  When not in passive mode, the server
                 also uses the next lower port to establish a second connec-
                 tion (called the data connection) back to the client.

     --PP _r_a_n_g_e    Sets the range of server TCP ports to be used for the data
                 connection, when in passive mode.  _R_a_n_g_e may be a single
                 integer or a range given as `lo-hi'.

     --ss _s_c_a_n_D_i_r  Enables mirror mode, and specifies the directory under which
                 the scan files can be found.  If it is not an absolute path-
                 name, _s_c_a_n_D_i_r is interpreted relative to the base directory.
                 See _R_U_N_N_I_N_G _A _C_V_S_u_p _M_I_R_R_O_R _S_I_T_E, below.

     --vv          Prints the version number and exits, without serving any
                 clients.

     --ZZ _c_o_m_p_r_L_e_v_e_l
                 Sets the compression level to _c_o_m_p_r_L_e_v_e_l.  The compression
                 level must be between 0 and 9.  A level of 0 means no com-
                 pression, while 9 provides maximum compression.  The default
                 level is 1.  Higher levels provide relatively little improve-
                 ment, at a rather high cost in CPU cycles.

PPRREEPPAARRIINNGG AA FFIILLEE CCOOLLLLEECCTTIIOONN RREEPPOOSSIITTOORRYY
     The file collections which ccvvssuuppdd makes available to clients are
     described by various configuration files.  The configuration files reside
     under the directory _b_a_s_e_/_c_o_l_l_D_i_r, where _b_a_s_e is the directory specified
     by the --bb _b_a_s_e command line option, or _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_e_t_c_/_c_v_s_u_p by default.
     _c_o_l_l_D_i_r is any of the directories specified with the --cc option, or `sup'
     by default.

     Each collection's configuration files are kept in a separate subdirectory
     of _b_a_s_e_/_c_o_l_l_D_i_r, named after the collection itself.  For example, the
     configuration for the `src-base' collection would be found in
     _b_a_s_e_/_c_o_l_l_D_i_r_/_s_r_c_-_b_a_s_e.  Within the collection's subdirectory, there
     should be a _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_s file and a list file.  The _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_s file contains
     one line per release.  The first word of each line is the name of the
     release, e.g., `cvs'.  That must be followed by the following phrases, in
     any order:

     lliisstt==_f_i_l_e   Specifies the name of the list file, relative to the collec-
                 tion's subdirectory.  The list file is described below.

     pprreeffiixx==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                 Specifies where the files making up the collection are to be
                 found.  If _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is not an absolute pathname, it is
                 interpreted relative to the base directory _b_a_s_e.  If there is
                 no pprreeffiixx clause, the prefix defaults to _b_a_s_e.

     kkeeyywwoorrddpprreeffiixx==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                 Specifies a ``pseudo-prefix'' which is used only for expand-
                 ing the absolute pathnames for the `$Header: /opt/cvs/cm3/m3-tools/cvsup/server/src/cvsupd.cat,v 1.1.1.1 2009-04-09 17:01:47 jkrell Exp $' and `$Source: /opt/cvs/cm3/m3-tools/cvsup/server/src/cvsupd.cat,v $'
                 RCS keywords.  The _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y should normally be the absolute
                 pathname of the CVS repository on the machine containing the
                 master copy of the repository.  The use of kkeeyywwoorrddpprreeffiixx
                 ensures that CCVVSSuupp will expand the RCS keywords identically
                 on all machines, even though the repositories may reside in
                 different directories.

     ssuuppeerr==_c_o_l_l_e_c_t_i_o_n
                 Specifies the immediate super-collection of the current col-
                 lection.  In large distributions, the collections are often
                 organized in a hierarchical manner.  At the top of the hier-
                 archy is a collection containing all of the distributed
                 files.  At the next level are several sub-collections, each
                 containing a subset of the files.  Each sub-collection may in
                 turn have further sub-collections, and so forth.  The ssuuppeerr
                 keyword specifies the collection's parent in such a hierar-
                 chical arrangement.

                 This keyword is optional.  If it is omitted, ccvvssuuppdd assumes
                 nothing about the relationship between the current collection
                 and the other available collections.

                 Information from the ssuuppeerr keywords is used for finding the
                 appropriate scan files when the server is running as a mirror
                 site.  See _R_U_N_N_I_N_G _A _C_V_S_u_p _M_I_R_R_O_R _S_I_T_E.

     nnoocchheecckkrrccss  Disables the comparison of MD5 checksums for updated RCS
                 files.  Checksum mismatches for RCS files may not be meaning-
                 ful, since a given logical RCS file can have many different
                 textual renditions.

     nnoorrccss       Disables special processing for RCS files.  They will be
                 treated the same as other files.

     nnoorrssyynncc     Disables the use of the _r_s_y_n_c algorithm.  NNoottee:: this keyword
                 is deprecated in the _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_s file.  Use nnoorrssyynncc or rrnnoorrssyynncc
                 in the list file instead.  (See below.)

     Unrecognized phrases are accepted but ignored, for backward compatibility
     with the ssuupp package.  Note that even though ccvvssuuppdd often serves only a
     single release, the _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_s file is still required.

     The list file specifies the details of how to upgrade the client's ver-
     sion of the collection.  Each line contains a single command.  Blank
     lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.  Any filenames speci-
     fied are taken as relative to the pprreeffiixx directory given in the _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_s
     file.

     Many of the list file commands accept file name patterns as arguments.
     These are similar to the patterns accepted by sh(1), and may include the
     wild card constructs `*', `'?, and `[...]'.  With the exception of
     oommiittaannyy patterns, any slash characters in file names must be matched
     explicitly by slash characters in the pattern.  Leading periods in file
     names are not treated specially.  For example, the pattern `*' matches
     the filename `.profile'.

     uuppggrraaddee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 All files and directories matching any of the given patterns
                 will be included in the list of files to be upgraded.  If a
                 directory name is matched, it recursively includes all files
                 and subdirectories within it.

     aallwwaayyss _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 This command is the same as uuppggrraaddee, except that it overrides
                 any oommiittaannyy commands.

     oommiittaannyy _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 Files or directories matching any of the given patterns will
                 be omitted from the upgrade.  If a directory name is matched,
                 then it and all files and subdirectories beneath it are omit-
                 ted.

                 The patterns for oommiittaannyy are interpreted differently than
                 other patterns.  For normal patterns, a slash character in a
                 pathname must be matched explicitly by a slash character in
                 the pattern.  For oommiittaannyy patterns, slashes are treated the
                 same as other characters.  Thus the pattern `*.c' will match
                 any pathname ending in `.c', including, for example,
                 `foo/bar/lam.c'.

     ssyymmlliinnkk _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 Symbolic links matching any of the given patterns will be
                 upgraded as symbolic links, rather than as the files they
                 refer to.  Otherwise, symbolic links are followed and their
                 target files are sent to the client.

     rrssyymmlliinnkk _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 This command is similar to ssyymmlliinnkk, but if a directory is
                 matched, all symbolic links beneath it in the tree are
                 treated as matched.

     nnoorrssyynncc _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 The rsync algorithm will not be used for updating files
                 matching any of the given patterns.  This is useful for log
                 files, where CCVVSSuupp's ``append'' optimization is more effec-
                 tive than the rsync algorithm.

     rrnnoorrssyynncc _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.
                 This command is similar to nnoorrssyynncc, but if a directory is
                 matched, all files beneath it in the tree are treated as
                 matched.

     eexxeeccuuttee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d (_p_a_t_t_e_r_n _._._.)
                 The given _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be executed by the client whenever a
                 file matching one of the _p_a_t_t_e_r_ns is successfully updated.
                 The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d comprises all words up to the first (`' charac-
                 ter.  Any occurrences of the string `%s' are replaced by the
                 pathname of the updated file on the client host.  Occurrences
                 of `%%' are replaced by `%'.  The command is executed by
                 passing it to _/_b_i_n_/_s_h.

                 There may be multiple patterns, separated by white space.
                 They are interpreted relative to the pprreeffiixx directory.  Each
                 pattern should be written to match the appropriate files as
                 they exist on the _s_e_r_v_e_r.  For example, the `,v' suffix of an
                 RCS file name must be matched, even though that suffix will
                 not be present on the client if checkout mode is in effect.
                 Slashes in file names must be matched by explicit slashes in
                 the pattern.  CVS `Attic' directories are implicitly included
                 in the matching process, and should not be specified directly
                 in the patterns.  A matching file will be found whether it is
                 in the Attic or not.

                 If an eexxeeccuuttee statement matches a directory, its command is
                 executed if the directory is created for the first time, or
                 if its attributes are changed.  The command is executed when
                 ascending out of the directory, i.e., after its files and
                 subdirectories have been processed.

                 If multiple eexxeeccuuttee statements match a file, all of the asso-
                 ciated commands are executed in sequence.

                 For security reasons, the client may choose to ignore all
                 eexxeeccuuttee statements.

     Unrecognized commands are accepted but ignored, for backward compatibil-
     ity with ssuupp.

RRUUNNNNIINNGG AA CCVVSSuupp MMIIRRRROORR SSIITTEE
     A mirror is a server which obtains and updates its files from a master
     site by means of CCVVSSuupp, and redistributes them via CCVVSSuupp to other sites.
     Mirror sites are commonly used in large projects to spread the load among
     a number of servers.  The files being distributed originate at a master
     site.  Each mirror site updates its own copies of the files periodically
     from there.  Clients in turn obtain their updates from any of the mirror
     sites.

     ccvvssuuppdd has a special mode of operation for mirror sites that dramatically
     increases its efficiency.  This mode is enabled by the --ss _s_c_a_n_D_i_r option
     on the command line.  Without the --ss option, ccvvssuuppdd makes a full file
     tree traversal over the files in each requested collection, performing a
     stat(2) system call on every file.  It does this for each client that
     connects to it, on the assumption that any of the files could change at
     any time.  Such a traversal imposes a heavy seek load on the disks con-
     taining the files, and limits the number of clients that can be served
     simultaneously.

     On a mirror site, the files in the collections are known to change only
     when new versions of them come in via CCVVSSuupp.  The --ss option allows ccvvssuuppdd
     to take advantage of this property to completely avoid the file tree
     traversals.  This reduces the disk load on the server by orders of magni-
     tude.  In place of the file tree traversal, ccvvssuuppdd gets the necessary
     information about the files in the collections by reading _s_c_a_n files.
     The scan files are created by the ccvvssuupp client when it updates the files
     on the mirror site from the originals at the master site.  In CVSUP(1),
     these files are referred to as _l_i_s_t files.  Both names refer to the same
     files.  Each time ccvvssuuppdd serves a client, it finds the scan files created
     by the most recent update from the master site.  Thus the server always
     has fully up-to-date information about the files in the collections,
     without the need to perform a file tree traversal.

     The --ss option is followed by a directory name which specifies where the
     scan files can be found.  It is normally a subdirectory of the base
     directory, and it must match the location where the ccvvssuupp client main-
     tains its list files.  By default, ccvvssuupp locates these files under the
     _s_u_p subdirectory of the base directory.  To match this, ccvvssuuppdd should be
     run with `-s sup'.  If ccvvssuupp's list file location is changed from the
     default using the --cc option, then ccvvssuuppdd's scan directory must be changed
     the same way.  There is no default for the --ss option.  If it is not given
     explicitly on the command line, no scan files are used.

     There does not need to be a scan file for every collection.  ccvvssuuppdd first
     looks for the scan file for the collection requested by the client.  If
     that scan file does not exist, ccvvssuuppdd tries the scan files for each suc-
     cessive super-collection, and uses the first one it finds.  (See the
     description of the ssuuppeerr keyword in _P_R_E_P_A_R_I_N_G _A _F_I_L_E _C_O_L_L_E_C_T_I_O_N
     _R_E_P_O_S_I_T_O_R_Y for details.)  If no suitable scan file is located, ccvvssuuppdd
     falls back on performing a file tree traversal.

     Access to the server is unrestricted by default, but there is a reason-
     ably flexible mechanism for limiting access based on the IP addresses of
     connecting clients.  It is enabled by placing a set of rules into the
     access file _b_a_s_e_/_c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s.  The access file is a text file with one
     rule per line.  Comments begin with `#' and extend to the end of the
     line.  White space is ignored except where it is needed to separate adja-
     cent tokens.  Blank lines are ignored.

     Each rule consists of the following components:

     ··   A flag indicating whether the rule is a _p_e_r_m_i_t rule, an _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e
         rule, or a _d_e_n_y rule.  The flag is expressed as a single character:
         `+' means _p_e_r_m_i_t, `*' means _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e_, and `-' means _d_e_n_y_.

     ··   An IP address to compare with the client's IP address to determine
         whether the rule applies to the client.  This may be expressed either
         as a numeric IP address or as a host name.  Numeric addresses consist
         of 1 to 4 octet values, separated by dots.  If fewer than 4 octets
         are specified, the trailing octets are assumed to contain 0.

         Host names are converted to numeric addresses when they are read.  If
         a host has multiple addresses, a separate rule is added for each
         address.  This may or may not have the desired effect.

         Host names should be used with caution.  A name that is slow to
         resolve can bog down the server significantly.

     ··   A _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g mask to be ANDed with the IP addresses of the rule and the
         client before comparing the addresses.  This mask is specified as `/'
         followed by an integer giving the number of high-order 1s in the
         mask.  For example, `/24' specifies a mask of 0xffffff00.  The
         _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g mask is optional; if omitted, it defaults to `/32'.

     ··   A _c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g mask that determines how the clients that match the rule
         are counted.  (See below.)  It is specified the same way as the
         _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g mask.  The _c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g mask is optional; if omitted, it
         defaults to the same value as the _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g mask.

     ··   A _l_i_m_i_t specifying the maximum number of matching clients allowed at
         the same time.  This is specified as a decimal integer, preceded by
         white space to separate it from the preceding component.  The _l_i_m_i_t
         is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to 0 for a _d_e_n_y rule, or to
         infinity for a _p_e_r_m_i_t rule.

     When a client connects to the server, its IP address is checked against
     successive rules in sequence.  Each rule is processed as follows:

     1.   The IP address of the rule is compared with the IP address of the
          client, after ANDing each address with the _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g mask.  If the
          addresses do not match, the rule is ignored.

     2.   The IP addresses of all other currently connected clients are com-
          pared with the IP address of the connecting client, after ANDing
          each address with the _c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g mask.  If the number of matching
          clients (not counting the connecting client) is less than the _l_i_m_i_t,
          then the rule _s_u_c_c_e_e_d_s.  Otherwise, the rule _f_a_i_l_s.

     3.   If the rule is a _p_e_r_m_i_t rule and it succeeded, the client is allowed
          access, and the rest of the rules are ignored.

     4.   If the rule is an _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e rule and it succeeded, the server
          attempts to verify the client's identity using a challenge-response
          protocol (see _A_U_T_H_E_N_T_I_C_A_T_I_O_N, below).  Access is granted or denied
          based on the outcome of authentication.  The rest of the rules are
          ignored.

     5.   If the rule is a _d_e_n_y rule and it failed, the client is denied
          access, and the rest of the rules are ignored.

     6.   Otherwise, processing continues with the next rule.

     There is an implicit _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e rule at the end of the list which
     matches any IP address.  Thus, if the processing reaches the end of the
     list of rules without having allowed or denied access, access is con-
     trolled by the authentication mechanism.

     Here are some examples illustrating how the rules are commonly used.

           -spam.cyberpromo.com
     Deny all access from a specific host.

           +mirror.FreeBSD.org
     Permit unlimited access from a specific host.

           -user.FreeBSD.org 1
     Limit a specific host to at most 1 connection at a time.

           -198.211.214/24
     Deny all access from hosts in a specific class C address block.

           -198.211.214/24 3
     Allow at most 3 connections total from the hosts in a specific class C
     address block.

           -198.211.214/24/32 3
     Allow at most 3 connections from each of the hosts in a specific class C
     address block.

     Note the difference between the previous two examples.  The first example
     imposes a per-network limit, while the second example imposes a per-host
     limit.  The difference is in the _c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g mask.  The 24 bit mask in the
     first example produces a single counter that is shared by all of the
     hosts in the specified address block.  The 32 bit mask in this example
     produces a separate counter for each host.

           -0.0.0/0/24 1
     Allow no more than 1 connection at a time from each block of 256
     addresses.

           *0.0.0.0/0
     For all clients, use authentication to decide whether access is allowed.

     When updating the access file, it is not necessary to halt the server.
     But the file should be copied for editing, and then the new version
     should be moved atomically into place.  There is no need to signal the
     server after updating the file.  The server will notice that the file has
     been touched, and will rescan it automatically.  In addition, the server
     rescans the file every 3 hours to keep up with DNS changes that might
     affect the resolved addresses of host names.

     Syntax errors in individual rules are logged, and the offending rules are
     ignored.  Host name lookup failures are also logged.

AAUUTTHHEENNTTIICCAATTIIOONN
     CCVVSSuupp implements an authentication mechanism which can be used to control
     access to the server.  It uses a challenge-response protocol which is
     immune to packet sniffing and replay attacks.  No passwords are sent over
     the network in either direction.  Both the client and the server can
     independently verify the identities of each other.

     Authentication of the client is invoked by a successful _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e rule
     in the _b_a_s_e_/_c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s file, or by ``falling off the end'' of the
     file.  If there is no _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s file, clients are not authenticated.

     The file _b_a_s_e_/_c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d holds the information used for performing
     authentication.  This file contains a record for each client who is
     allowed access to the server.  Each record occupies one line in the file.
     Lines beginning with `#' are ignored, as are lines containing only white
     space.  White space is significant everywhere else in the file.  Fields
     are separated by `:' characters.

     The first record of the file is special.  It specifies the identity of
     the server itself.  This server record has the form:

           _s_e_r_v_e_r_N_a_m_e:_p_r_i_v_a_t_e_K_e_y

     _S_e_r_v_e_r_N_a_m_e is the canonical name of the server, e.g.,
     `CVSup.FreeBSD.ORG'.  This name is sent to the client, which uses it to
     choose an appropriate client name and shared secret for authentication.
     The name is case-insensitive.

     _P_r_i_v_a_t_e_K_e_y is any string of characters except `:'.  When the server gen-
     erates random challenges to send to the client, it uses _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_K_e_y to
     make the challenges harder to guess.  Challenges are random and quite
     unpredictable in any case, so the _p_r_i_v_a_t_e_K_e_y isn't really very important.
     It can be left empty if desired, but the `:' that precedes it must be
     present.

     All of the remaining records in the file correspond to individual
     clients.  Each client record has the following form:

           _c_l_i_e_n_t_N_a_m_e:_s_h_a_r_e_d_S_e_c_r_e_t:_c_l_a_s_s:_c_o_m_m_e_n_t

     All fields must be present even if some of them are empty.  _C_l_i_e_n_t_N_a_m_e is
     the name of the client to which the record applies.  By convention, e-
     mail addresses are used for all client names, e.g.,
     `BillyJoe@FreeBSD.ORG'.  Client names are case-insensitive.

     _S_h_a_r_e_d_S_e_c_r_e_t is a secret string of characters known only to the client
     and the server.  It is generated from a password chosen by the client,
     using the ccvvppaasssswwdd utility.  The client proves its identity to the server
     (and vice versa) by demonstrating that it knows the _s_h_a_r_e_d_S_e_c_r_e_t.  A
     client's access may be disabled by changing its _s_h_a_r_e_d_S_e_c_r_e_t field to
     `*'.

     The shared secret is never sent across the network, nor can it be used to
     find out the client's password.  However, given the shared secret, a mod-
     ified version of ccvvssuupp could impersonate the client.  Thus, care must be
     taken to ensure that the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d file is readable only by the
     server.

     _C_l_a_s_s is reserved for future use.  It should be empty.

     _C_o_m_m_e_n_t contains any additional information about the client that might
     be useful to the server administrator.  For example, it may contain the
     client's full name and other contact information.

     When updating the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d file, it is not necessary to halt the
     server.  But the file should be copied for editing, and then the new ver-
     sion should be moved atomically into place.  There is no need to signal
     the server after updating the file.

     Syntax errors in individual records of the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d file are logged,
     and the offending records are ignored.

     Here is a summary of the interactions between the access control and
     authentication mechanisms.  The key principle is that access control
     takes place first.  The outcome of access control determines whether
     authentication is performed too.

     1.   If there is no _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s file, then all clients are granted
          access.  No authentication is done, even if _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d exists.

     2.   If the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s file exists but is empty, all clients are sub-
          jected to authentication.  If _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d does not exist, nobody
          can access the server.

     3.   If _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s exists and has some rules in it, but there is no
          _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d file, then successful _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e rules cause access
          to be denied.  Access is still granted to those who match successful
          _p_e_r_m_i_t rules.  Falling off the end of the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s file results
          in denial of access.

     4.   If both the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s and _c_v_s_u_p_d_._p_a_s_s_w_d files exist, then:
          ··   Successful _p_e_r_m_i_t rules cause access to be granted without
              authentication.
          ··   Successful _a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_e rules cause authentication to be per-
              formed.  Access is granted or denied based on the outcome of
              that.  Falling off the end of the _c_v_s_u_p_d_._a_c_c_e_s_s file is included
              in this case.
          ··   Failing _d_e_n_y rules cause access to be denied.

     In checkout mode, CCVVSSuupp expands RCS keywords as described in co(1).  It
     expands all of the standard keywords, and also the non-standard
     `$CVSHeader$' keyword.  This expands the same as `$Header: /opt/cvs/cm3/m3-tools/cvsup/server/src/cvsupd.cat,v 1.1.1.1 2009-04-09 17:01:47 jkrell Exp $', except that
     the RCS file's pathname is expressed relative to the pprreeffiixx directory,
     rather than as an absolute pathname.  The pprreeffiixx is assumed to be the
     root of the CVS repository.

     It is also possible to define aliases for the standard RCS keywords, and
     to selectively enable or disable the recognition of individual keywords.
     These properties are controlled on a repository-wide basis by directives
     in a file named _p_r_e_f_i_x_/_C_V_S_R_O_O_T_/_o_p_t_i_o_n_s.  Each directive occupies one line
     of the file.  Comments begin with `#' and extend to the end of line.
     Blank lines are ignored.  The syntax is ridiculous, for historical rea-
     sons.

     To define a keyword alias, use a line of the form:
           tag=_a_l_i_a_s[=_k_e_y_w_o_r_d]
     For example:
           tag=FreeBSD=CVSHeader
     defines a new RCS keyword `$FreeBSD$', which expands the same as
     `$CVSHeader$'.  If the second `=' and the _k_e_y_w_o_r_d are omitted, the key-
     word defaults to `Id'.

     To disable all but certain selected keywords, use a line of the form:
           tagexpand=i_k_e_y_w_o_r_d[,_._._.]
     For example:
           tagexpand=iFreeBSD,Id
     disables the expansion of all keywords except `$FreeBSD$' and `$Id: cvsupd.cat,v 1.1.1.1 2009-04-09 17:01:47 jkrell Exp $'.
     The leading `i' stands for ``include''.

     To enable all but certain selected keywords, use a line of the form:
           tagexpand=e_k_e_y_w_o_r_d[,_._._.]
     For example:
           tagexpand=eFreeBSD,Id
     enables the expansion of all keywords except `$FreeBSD$' and `$Id: cvsupd.cat,v 1.1.1.1 2009-04-09 17:01:47 jkrell Exp $'.  The
     leading `e' stands for ``exclude''.

     the server was started, then the server will reject all new incoming con-
     nection requests.  Clients which had already started will run to comple-
     tion, but no new ones will be accepted.  This mechanism is awkward and
     weak, and will probably be changed in a future release.

     ccvvssuuppdd does not create or write any files, except for its log file if one
     is specified on the command line.  There is thus little risk that ccvvssuuppdd
     can be subverted into damaging the system on which it is running.  A more
     likely risk is that ccvvssuuppdd might be spoofed into sending out files that
     are not intended to be publicly distributed.  ccvvssuuppdd is very careful to
     prevent this from happening.  Nevertheless, for maximum protection it is
     a good idea to run ccvvssuuppdd as a completely unprivileged user analogous to
     `nobody', serving only files that are readable by everyone.

     CCVVSSuupp has no provision for encrypting the data sent across the network.
     If secrecy is desired then the connection can be tunneled through sssshh.
