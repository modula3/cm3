    <h3>What is Modula-3</h3>

    <p>
      <em>
        This paragraph is borrowed from the
        <a href="http://modula3.elegosoft.com/pm3/intro/questions/questions.html">
          Modula-3 FAQ</a></em>. 
    <p>
      Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from
      Mesa, Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+.  It also resembles its
      cousins Object Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be
      while meeting the needs of modern systems programmers.  Instead
      of exploring new features, we studied the features of the Modula
      family of languages that have proven themselves in practice and
      tried to simplify them into a harmonious language.  We found
      that most of the successful features were aimed at one of two
      main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler, more systematic
      type system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
      provision for explicit interfaces between modules.  It adds
      objects and classes, exception handling, garbage collection,
      lightweight processes (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe
      features.
    </p>

    <h3>What is CM3?</h3>

    <p>
      <b>CM3</b> is the <b>open source</b> release of 
      Critical Mass Modula-3. It is a complete easy-to-use and
      easy-to-install Modula-3 system that contains considerable
      enhancements over its ancestor DEC SRC Modula-3. Read <a
      href="about-cm3.html">About CM3</a> to learn more.

    <h3>Contributions and Acknowledgements</h3>

    <p>
      A lot of people have contributed to the original M3 release by
      DEC SRC, and the 5.1 code release is almost entirely the
      work of members of Critical Mass. I don't know all the names and
      cannot provide a list here. It would also not have been possible
      for me to setup this distribution without PM3 Modula-3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several people have contributed to the open source
      releases of CM3 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 since the announcement of its
      availability for test. The latest release notes contain some
      names, but I still haven't got around to provide a complete
      list. Please don't be annoyed if you don't find your name
      mentioned here yet; just send me some lines with the
      contributions you would like to be mentioned, and I'll put
      together a list and publish it.

    <h3>A Note about Reactor</h3>
    </a>

    <p>
      Critical Mass used to distribute their CM3 compiler as the core
      component of the Reactor GUI. This software is now available as
      CM3IDE thanks to the efforts of Randy Coleburn.
