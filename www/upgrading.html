    <h2>Upgrading CM3</h2>

    <p>
      Upgrading CM3 means building a complete new release of CM3 with
      an already installed system. Usually, this should be very easy,
      as you only have to use one or two of the existing build
      scripts, for example,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>./scripts/do-cm3-core.sh buildship</tt><br>
      <tt>./scripts/do-cm3-std.sh buildship</tt>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      However, there is one situation when it's not as easy as this:
      when a new target platform has been added to the compiler, or
      the order or names of existing target platforms in certain files
      have changed. If you just use the scripts named above, you will
      run into problems in libm3, such as
    </p>
    <pre>
 new source -> compiling ProcessPosix.m3
 new source -> compiling SocketPosix.m3

 Fatal Error: bad version stamps: SocketPosix.m3 
 
 version stamp mismatch: Compiler.Platform 
   <00df7acd080d2be7> => SocketPosix.m3 
   <b388e13e20d650e9> => Compiler.i3 
 version stamp mismatch: Compiler.ThisPlatform 
   <4d31a453f94cbb46> => SocketPosix.m3 
   <fe663fa0d197c048> => Compiler.i3 
  *** execution of  failed ***</pre>
    <p>
      This is because you can only compile some platform specific code
      in m3core and libm3 with a compiler that includes exactly the
      same list of target platforms in Target.i3, InfoModule.m3, and
      Compiler.i3; otherwise version stamps will get messed up. So you
      have to make all the changes, build and ship the compiler
      packages m3middle, m3front, m3quake, cm3, install the compiler,
      and then build the libraries m3core and libm3 and the compiler
      packages again (do-cm3-core.sh).
    </p>
    <p>
	The above is no longer true. The large enum listing all targets is
	no longer in the runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of Sat Jul 19, 2003, there is a script that performs a safe
      update for you by compiling and shipping the right packages in
      the correct order:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>./scripts/upgrade.sh</tt>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You can call it with the -n (no action) option to see what it
      would do.
    </p>
