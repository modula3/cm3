CM3 Free Distribution -- scripts/README

This directory contains various scripts that can be used to compile /
build / bootstrap part or all of the CM3 source distribution.

These scripts can be divided in those that can be called directly and
those intended for inclusion only. They are all standard Bourne shell
scripts and should be executable on every system (sometimes probably
some minor tweaks might be needed). On Windows, you can use the Cygwin
distribution which comes with bash and most of the GNU tools, or the
MKS tool kit and its Korn shell. Alternatively, you may want to use
the Windows CMD scripts contributed by Randy Coleburn. See README-WIN32
for details. Alternatively, you may want to use the Windows CMD scripts
in the win directory contributed by Jay Krell. They work very much like
the sh scripts documented here. Or the Python scripts in the python
directory.

You are probably most interested in one of the following:

 o Use boot-cm3-with-m3.sh and do-cm3-core.sh to boot the system using
   another M3 compiler.

 o Use do-cm3-min.sh to compile the minimal set of CM3 libraries.

 o Use do-cm3-base.sh to compile a basic system without GUI.

 o Use do-cm3-std.sh to compile a standard system with GUI and full
   networking support.

 o Use do-pkg.sh to compile or clean one or more arbitrary packages.

 o Use do-cm3-front.sh to build (and install) a build system, i.e., the 
   compiler, its support libraries, and support utilities.

 o Use do-cm3-unicode.sh to build (and install) what do-cm3-front builds,
   plus the unicode encoding suport library libunicode.  This latter package
   will build successfully only when the build compiler is configured for
   full Unicode range WIDECHAR. 

 o Use do-cm3-core.sh to build (and install) a core cm3 system, i.e.
   the compiler with some useful base libraries.

 o Use upgrade.sh to build and install a new compiler version from
   sources. This may be difficult, since packages have to be built and
   shipped in the correct order, and once you've shipped something
   wrong, you may be stuck.

 o Use install-cm3-compiler.sh to install the actual compiler
   (front-end and back-end) from the workspace.

Each of the do-cm3-*.sh scripts takes an action as an argument, which
translates into options to the cm3 command(s) executed by the script,
according to the following table:

   do-cm3-*.sh argument:                cm3 command(s) and options:

   <no argument>, build, buildlocal     cm3 -build -override ...
   buildglobal, buildship               cm3 -build ...; cm3 -ship ...
   ship                                 cm3 -ship ...
   clean, cleanlocal                    cm3 -clean -override ...
   cleanglobal                          cm3 -clean ...
     
In the common case of just building parts of CM3, you do not want any
action that results in -override.  One effect -override will have is to
install a libm3 that will usually make compilations fail with a message
about ROOT being undefined. Normally, use buildship. 

There is no action argument to the do-cm3-*.sh scripts that will just
build, without shipping, but without overrides either. 

Please read the file README.BOOT for booting and porting instructions.
Read the file README.ELEGO for instructions how to use CM3 together
with the Elego ComPact project manager, which also allows you to
compile, clean, and version control CM3 packages. Actually, these
scripts are only an imperfect attempt to re-implement some of the ComPact
project manager's functions for M3 packages.

Here are some short notes about the purpose of each script:

sysinfo.sh [include]
----------
  defines variables containing general system information, specifying
  the M3OSTYPE (WIN32|POSIX), compiler TARGET, if a GCC_BACKEND is used,
  the INSTALLROOT etc. This script needs to be adapted for every new
  supported platform. Also exports some other general useful functions
  like debug() and header().

find-packages.sh [include | callable ]
----------------
  builds a list of directories in $PKGSDB (scripts/PKGS) that are
  probably Modula-3 package roots. This list is used to locate
  packages by name.

pkginfo.sh [include]
----------
  builds the $PKGSDB if it does not exist and exports the functions
  pkg_defined() and pkgpath()

pkgcmds.sh [include]
----------
  defines basic commands applicable to Modula-3 packages depending on
  information from sysinfo.sh and some simple tests. Exports the
  functions map_action(), add_action_opts(), extract_options(),
  get_args() and show_usage(), as well as generic usage texts GEN_CMDS
  and GEN_OPTS.
  map_action() currently knows about the commands build or buildlocal,
  buildglobal or buildship, ship, clean or cleanlocal, cleanglobal,
  and realclean. `local' means that overrides are used to locate all
  imported packages in the current workspace, `global' means that
  packages from the installed CM3 system are used and also shipped
  there.

pkgmap.sh [callable]
---------
  applies a command passed with the -c option or in PKG_ACTION to a
  set of packages passed on the command line. Also understands -n (no
  actions) and -k (keep going in case of errors). This is the basic
  command mapper used by all the following scripts.

boot-cm3-with-m3.sh [callable]
-------------------
  tries to boot the CM3 source distribution (the actual compiler)
  using another existing Modula-3 compiler. Only the minimal set of
  needed packages is compiled.

do-cm3-base.sh [callable]
--------------
  builds / ships / cleans the CM3 base distribution:
  m3core, libm3, m3middle, m3quake, m3scanner, m3tools, m3cgcat,
  m3cggen, m3bundle, bitvector, digraph, parseparams, realgeometry,
  set, slisp, sortedtableextras, table-list, tempfiles, and tcp.
  WIN32 =>  tapi, mklib, fix_nl, libdump.
  HAVE_SERIAL => serial
  HAVE_TCL => tcl

do-cm3-comm.sh [callable]
--------------
  builds / ships / cleans the CM3 communication packages:
  tcp, netobj, netobjd, m3tk, stubgen.
  WIN32 => tapi
  HAVE_SERIAL => serial

do-cm3-core.sh [callable]
--------------
  builds / ships / cleans the CM3 core packages. This is what should
  to be used in addition to boot-cm3-with-m3.sh to boot this CM3
  distribution on a new system:

  m3core, libm3, m3middle, m3linker, m3front, m3quake, cm3, m3scanner,
  m3tools, m3cgcat, m3cggen, m3bundle, bitvector, digraph,
  parseparams, realgeometry, set, slisp, sortedtableextras,
  table-list, tempfiles, m3back,
  WIN32 =>  m3objfile, tapi, mklib, fix_nl, libdump
  GCC_BACKEND => m3cc
  M3GDB => m3gdb
  HAVE_TCL => tcl
  OMIT_GCC => omit package m3cc

upgrade.sh [callable]
----------
  builds and ships several core cm3 packages in the correct order
  (some two times) to perform a correct bootstrapping of a new
  compiler version with different target platforms. The packages
  concerned are the same as in do-cm3-core.sh.

install-cm3-compiler.sh [callable]
-----------------------
  install-cm3-compiler.sh [ -n ] backup | newversion | upgrade
  install-cm3-compiler.sh [ -n ] restore <version_number>

    backup
      will make copies of cm3 front-end and back-end with the cm3
      version number as suffix, e.g.
      /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3 --> /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3-x.y.z
      /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3cg --> /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3cg-x.y.z

    restore <version_number>
      will restore copies with suffixed version number as current
      version, e.g.
      /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3-x.y.z --> /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3
      /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3cg-x.y.z --> /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3cg

    newversion
      will install the version from the current workspace with
      version number suffixes, e.g.
      /home/wagner/work/cm3/m3-sys/cm3/FreeBSD4/cm3 
        --> /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3-x.y.z
      /home/wagner/work/cm3/m3-sys/m3cc/FreeBSD4/cm3cg
         --> /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3cg-x.y.z

    upgrade
      will backup the existing version, install new executables
      with suffixes and restore them as the current version

    Beware: This script relies on the cm3 executable to correctly
    identify its version (cm3 -version). If it does not, things will
    get messed up.

do-cm3-gui.sh [callable]
-------------
  builds / ships / cleans the CM3 graphical user interface packages:

  ui, vbtkit, tcp, cmvbt, jvideo, videovbt, web, formsvbtpixmaps,
  formsvbt, formsview, formsedit
  no WIN32 => X11R4

do-cm3-min.sh [callable]
-------------
  builds / ships / cleans the CM3 minimal library set:

  m3core, libm3

do-cm3-std.sh [callable]
-------------
  builds / ships / cleans the standard CM3 distribution packages. This
  list is intended to grow during the next releases. There are lots of
  packages, but not all do currently compile, and not all work
  correctly, so this is intended to define a standard set of working
  packages including graphical user interface and communication.

  m3core, libm3, m3middle, m3linker, m3front, m3quake, cm3, m3scanner,
  m3tools, m3cgcat, m3cggen, m3bundle, bitvector, digraph,
  parseparams, realgeometry, set, slisp, sortedtableextras,
  table-list, tempfiles, tcp, netobj, netobjd, m3tk, stubgen, ui,
  vbtkit, cmvbt, jvideo, videovbt, web, formsvbtpixmaps, formsvbt,
  formsview, formsedit, m3objfile, mklib, fix_nl, libdump, m3back,
  m3staloneback
  no WIN32 => X11R4
  WIN32 => tapi
  GCC_BACKEND => m3cc
  M3GDB => m3gdb
  HAVE_TCL => tcl
  HAVE_SERIAL => serial
  OMIT_GCC => omit package m3cc

do-pkg.sh [callable]
---------
  builds / ships / cleans one or more CM3 packages passed as arguments
  on the command line. Recognizes generic options and commands.

make-bin-dist-min.sh [callable]
--------------------
  Builds a minimal binary distribution archive for one platform
  containing the compiler, low-level system libraries, m3core, libm3,
  and the installation program. Uses STAGE [TMPDIR] as working
  area. You only need this if you want to create your own CM3
  distributions. 

ppc-cross-build.sh [callable]
------------------
  example for a cross-compilation script for bootstrapping new platforms
